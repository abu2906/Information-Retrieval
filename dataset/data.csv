The Beginning of Behemoth,IRIS Official,the beginning of behemoth legend a word with promise of history written in stone legend foretold of a land long and far its sanctum drizzled with magma darkness skies crimson red and mountains cutting through the anxious clouds it is here on this hellish nadir that legend was born and would most surely be tested through the eye of the beholderlong ago lived a symbol of beginnings and ends to our lives the galaxy brings gifts and these gifts are spread far and wide there lived a treasure from unknown territory far beyond legend one born for archival tainted with our very pasts presents and futures an emblem only the most powerful could harness this emblem would be known in myth as the iris emblem it seeks to protect the course of nature by paving neutral peace against divergent chaosthe emblem originated from a solid foundation floating through our cosmos a mystical paraphernalia named ether plummeting toward a chasm like magma boulder it is there that a gateway to the afterlife was created an open breach for the deceased to roam freethere stood the first two beings to walk this abyss sent from afar two strays from outer worlds in pursuit of the emblem father tyrant and lady fate born from unknown territories to us it was here they had scattered the molten field in search of what they desired days turned to months minutes began to feel like a millenniaalas what they were destined to find was merely a morsel of what laid among the horizon several lost souls roamed this hellscape darkness engrossed the layers of rock with a sentient and darkened energy many of these souls lived with a thickened layer of evil attached to them emitting vitriol resonance but of course many projected a more fragile presence coupled with ones of courage it so happens that this land has existed for centuries devoid of life it became a field of hopelessness and decay souls violently swinging for one another it appears the core was nothing shy of harsh territory for both tyrant and fate a land recalled in tales as the depthsthere on the apex of the depths lived a ruler of these spirits king vyson pavavorey exterior like charcoal interior of bloodshed vyson had allowed anarchy to breed throughtout the depths and continue the damnation for eons he is said to have given on peace as it was a formidable work of fiction and fantasy and thus order through trials of fire were put in placefather tyrant and lady fate climbed to this peak as night turned to day without a glimmer of what night and day meant here once reaching the top the warrior from within spoke to their instinct pushed for ingress between the gates of this fortress and land prey to a battleground where the trial by fire commences and so the fight begins foreign heroes against the pavavorey tribeit is with great haste suspense sacrifice and pride that long after the fight vyson had been dethroned laying on the ground in remnants of ash before he could perish faint and threatening fates were beckoned to the two heroespick the fruit from a tree and it will come downwith no plato beholding comes the end to the crownas thee cast blindness to the shadows up therelay waste to the paradigm born from blackness' glarenot even we of coal may proclaim victoryas a deep looming manifest will create darker historybypolesian claustronoctus anxosax tormentus and grief their immortality would thriveas when all would join forces bring out the mothohiveheed those words well and prey not go unguidedsuch is the pavavorey's final smile when your world becomes surely dividedwe will never be too far so perish as you may have already decidedfog clouded the room as tyrant emits one final cast of his staff a wormhole is opened where the pavavorey colonials perished sent to live in an eternity of nothingness forever suddenly what was once blocked from entry a liquid substance floods from the fortress and what was once merely a ring shaped crevice filled with substance in a matter of minutes what we would come to call omen water a purification liquidit is with this victory tyrant and fate built a brand new order for the depths new decrees were made to keep order and peace in harmony they discovered the iris was capable of harnessing far more than just spiritual essence but was driven to bring extra protection and power through the omen water post haste lady fate combines the river with the iris emblem and is now capable of purification in spirits and delegation between those that are corrupt and those who were born for something more as new spirits came flooding through the lands more would land in the omen rivers those who were corrupt were banished to the same endless void the pavavorey colony remained those who remained untainted were given entry to the onyx colony and remained there forever in a new afterlifeyears had passed the depths was colonised creating societies made from the crimson onyx they stood upon however the new world flooded with colony civillians and the depths had become overwhelmed it was decided that many needed to leave knowing they could never banish innocent souls they had trained many up as arcadian soldiers in the event of an evident overturn casting them abilities risen from the mystical entities they beheldwhile these soldiers were trained for combat they were in for far more cataclysm than once thought the eruption of their wormhole had brought dark matter to life breeding a new devious energy across their scope built from unknown origin creatures started falling from the sky in the form of paradigm worms and leeching light from the depths as they dug underneath its surface charging straight towards the core such a curse had not gone unprepared as tyrant had planned for days like this one as did the headed warning from the fallen pavavorey as such he recruited the finest soldiers in the land to help protect what was soon to become the age of calamity once more  of the greatest arcanes and legion soldiers in their few marched alongside tyrant and fate through dangerous territories not explored since dawn beganmany days and months passed soldiers kings and queens still marching through gusts of anarchy they encountered their first monstrosities blocking their path each born from the culmination of paradigm worms leeching off the planet it seems they needed this essence to slowly become true to life in the form of chaotic and blackened creatures sizes bigger than our own the claustronoctus feril and felineesque the bypolesian a venomous and eight legged nightmare and the anxosax an aviator of destruction havoc ensued for hours before the soldiers all took their victory lap as the depth's first threats fled from the scenetravelling through the cave of blind fortunes tyrant and fate found a gauntlet and summoned many to ignite the flames once more bringing light inside the tomb of unwanted shadows to their misfortune they were not alone here paradigm worms lurked on the cave walls and on the ground soldiers were tasked in clearing the landscape from parasites until the time the gauntlet can be reignited many took the leap to travel far and many had chosen to stand their ground but after time took its course the gauntlet was ignited bleeding those flames through the cave when all became visible there lay a manifestation of chaos larger and more hellish than the last the grief worm stood tall boasting millions of jaws surrounding its entire body capable of constricting several at a time and using its many jaws to tear through flesh bones and even consuming spiritsthe fight was not lost and while many of the soldiers remained wounded desperate for health but sacrificial in other's own wealth of life to keep them alive above all the grief worm was defeated and also fled from the tomb it appears all had been banished from the depths the air grew thicker with silence the end of the tunnel felt nigh tyrant and fate decided to set camp for their squadron overnight to heal from their wounds day turned to night once more many songs were sung in merry cheer laughter inbound it was clear in their hearts victory was theirs and they could safely retreat homebut unfortunately hapiness was merely temporary as a large shriek resonated through the clouds so powerful it parted the sky as crimson red bled through the cave even stranger they were heralded with a largely emitted light that shone upon them distorting their sight tyrant and fate stood atop the cliff as the land traveled beyond mountains and hillsides there in the jaws of dawn beholdeth the largest beast ever to have swooped the depths wing span doubled its own body casting its monstrous size as a shadow across the entire peripheral view to make what felt like night again its eyes a rich blood red and large light absorbing antenni charging closer to the colony soldiers this was no ordinary encounter and by no means a threat to ignore after all the paradigm worms absorbed enough energy from the depths and could finally create its biggest and far from final form the mothohivesoldiers had their souls absorbed one by one many had fallen sacrificial healing was bestowed from allies and if not for those sacrificies may have stood the test of time together as one trying to keep one alive meant many had perished all the same to tyrant's astonishment however all but one had fallen and as the final bow for the soldier was taken all hope felt losttyrant and fate were the only ones left standing in a desolate haste tyrant opened up the wormhole to the very same dark abyss the pavavorey colony was banished the damned tyrant had come to forge a deal with vyson to bring these soldiers to life to best the beast again before it can get stronger to vyson's surprise his monologue turned out to have predicted the existence of these beasts of unknown origin fearing these beasts were only in myth it is now revealed to have come true and feeling backed into a corner vyson decided to bargain with tyrant in besting the beast once more so it may not harm again but a deal was made in return when the mightiest falls tyrant and fate's first born will be cast away to the damned never to be released again a cold hearted deal from an even colder hearted deviant however what other choice did the world have one dies for many to live a sacrifice tyrant felt was well madevyson begrudgingly passed tyrant a healing talisman the deal was also to flip the talisman and if landed on the right face will bring everything back land on the wrong face vyson keeps his regards with nothing to sacrifice in return with an anxious flip the talisman landed on the ground tyrant looked down and as a tear shed from his eyes the soldiers were revived once more being given a second chancethe all banded together once more channeled their arcane energy and charged for the mothohive it seems while mothohive may have been weakened the beast was capable of bringing one final blow to tyrant and fate they drew blood and the blood lay waste to mothohive's claws suddenly from the combination of tyrant and fate's blood and mothohive's resonant manifestation light emitted from the titan as a rather large and unknown object landed before them and with this the mothohive collapsed in a weakened state the soldiers banded together in victory once more collected the remnants of the mothohive and left to return back home tyrant and fate however remained with this new found creation it was a rather oddly shaped egg emitting a purple haze wrapping around a dark essencedays of concern went by as the travel home felt even more tiresome but out of surprise the egg began to hatch and what was inside came out neither dark matter nor human but what appeared to be the amalgamation of both a new breed had become of the depths and was adopted into care by tyrant and fate what felt like a victory to them gave new inspiration for the name in legend they would write for this new member to the colony and it was written that goliath was born

"Arabian Nights,Vol. 2 (Chap. 3)",Richard F. Burton,arabian nightsvol  chap  lyricstale of king omar bin alnu'uman and his sons sharrkan and zau almakanand what befel them of things seldseen and peregrinethe king asked her and what was their story and she answered it hath reached me o auspicious king that there was in the city of safety baghdad before the caliphate of abd almalik bin marwn a king omar bin alnu'umn highs who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the chosros of persia and the kaysars of eastern rome for none could warm himself at his fire nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray and when he was angered there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame he had made himself king over all quarters and allah had subjected to him all his creatures his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands east and west had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them hind and sind and sin the holy land alhijaz the rich mountains of alyaman and the archipelagos of india and china moreover he reigned supreme over the north country and diyr bakr or mesopotamia and over sudn the eastern negro land and the islands of the ocean and all the far famed rivers of the earth sayhn and jayhn nile and euphrates he sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote to provide him with true report and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for king omar bin alnu'uman for he was o ruler of the age a right noble king and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing this mighty monarch had a son yclept sharrkan who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban for this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater and made him heir to the kingdom after himself this prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old and allah subjected his servants to him by reason of his great might and prowess in battle now his father king omar had four wives legally married but allah had vouchsafed him no son by them save sharrkan whom he had begotten upon one of them and the rest were barren moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines after the number of days in the coptic year who were of all nations and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace for he had built twelve pavilions after the number of the months each containing thirty private chambers which thus numbered three hundred and three score wherein he lodged his handmaids and he appointed according to law for each one her night when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year and on this wise he abode for a length of time meanwhile his son sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities presently by decree of the decreer a handmaid among the handmaids of omar bin nu'uman became pregnant and her pregnancy being announced to the harim the king was informed thereof whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said haply it will be a son and so all my offspring will be males then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness but when the tidings came to sharrkan he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous and he said verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty so quoth he to himself if this concubine bear a male child i will kill it but he kept that intention hidden in his heart such was the case with sharrkan but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows she was a roumiyah a greek girl by name sofiyah or sophia whom the king of roum and lord of csarea had sent to king omar as a present together with great store of gifts and of rarities she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating now she had served the king on the night of his sleeping with her saying to him o king i desire of the god of the heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me so i may bring him up with the best of rearing and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence good manners and prudent bearinga speech which much pleased the king during her pregnancy she was instant in prayer fervently supplicating the lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her and allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool now the king had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female and in like way his son sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same in due time sophia was delivered of a child which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon so they announced this to all present in the room whereupon the king's messenger carried the news to him and sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy but after the two had departed quoth sophia to the midwives wait with me awhile for i feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her and allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child the wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon with forehead flower white and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light whereupon the mother rejoiced as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company and sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy the rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot and the tidings reached omar son of al nu'uman who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news then he rose and went to her and kissed her head after which he looked at the boy and bending over him kissed him whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music and the king gave order that the boy should be named zau almakn and his sister nuzhat alzamn they answered hearing and obedience and did his bidding so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside beyond the power of tongue to rehearse moreover the people of baghdad hearing that allah had blessed their king with issue decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom and the emirs and wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished king omar bin alnu'uman joy of his son zau almakan and of his daughter nuzhat alzaman wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts and dealt largesse to all gentle and simple who were present after this fashion he did for four days full told and he lavished upon sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth and every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the newborns and when four years had gone by he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions all this while his son sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father omar son of alnu'uman having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of nuzhat alzaman and they hid the intelligence from him until days and years had sped by whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights one day as king omar was sitting in his palace his chamberlains came in to him and kissing the ground before him said o king there be come ambassadors from the king of roum lord of constantinople the great and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree if the king commend us to introduce them we will so do and if not there is no disputing his behest he bade them enter and when they came in he turned to them and courteously receiving them asked them of their case and what was the cause of their coming they kissed the ground before him and said o king glorious and strong o lord of the arm that is long know that he who despatched us to thee is king afrdn lord of ionia land and of the nazarene armies the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of constantinople to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel the prince of casarea and the cause of this war is as follows one of the kings of the arabs in past time during certain of his conquests chanced upon a hoard of the time of alexander whence he removed wealth past compute and amongst other things three round jewels big as ostrich eggs from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man upon each were graven characts in ionian characters and they have many virtues and properties amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a newborn child no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail when the arab king laid hands upon them and learned their secrets he sent to king afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned and he equipped for the mission two ships one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels for that he was king of the arabs and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the king of constantinople and they were bound to his port nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the great king afridun the two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the prince of caesarea who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships together with the three jewels and slew the crews when our king heard of this he sent an army against them but they routed it then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flightwhereupon the king waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army nor would he turn back from them till he had left caesarea of armenia in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her prince held sway so he sent us to the lord of the age and the time sultan omar bin alnu'uman king of baghdad and of khorasan desiring that he aid us with an army so may honour and glory accrue to him and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents and of the king's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance then the ambassadors kissed the ground before himand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the fortysixth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that after the ambassadors and retinue from the constantinopolitan king had kissed the ground before omar and had delivered their embassage they brought out the presents which were fifty damsels of the choicest from graecialand and fifty mamelukes in tunics of brocade belted with girdles of gold and silver each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one the girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money when the king saw them he rejoiced in them and accepted them then he bade the ambassadors be honourably entreated and summoning his wazirs took counsel with them of what he should do herewith rose up among them a wazir an ancient man dandan highs who kissed the ground before omar and said o king there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious and set over it thy son sharrkan with us as his lieutenants and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts first because the king of roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted and secondly because while no enemy dareth attack our country thine army may go forth safely and should it succour the king of graecialand and defeat his foe the glory will be thine moreover the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially when the tidings shall reach the islands of the ocean and the kings of mauritania shall hear it they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money the king pleased by the wazir's words and approving his rede gave him a dress of honour and said to him of the like of thee should kings ask counsel and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son sharrkan command the main battle then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down and he expounded to him the matter telling him what the ambassadors and the wazir dandan had said and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign enjoining him not to gainsay dandan in aught he should do moreover he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen armed cappie and inured to onset and stress of war accordingly sharrkan arose on the instant and chose out a myriad of horsemen after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them saying ye have delay of three days they kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions and provide provisions for the occasion whilst sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others when the appointed three days were ended the army drew out to the suburbs of baghdad city and king omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the king seven parcels of money then he turned to danden and commended to his care the army of his son and the wazir kissed the ground before him and answered i hear and i obey and lastly he charged sharrkan that he should consult the wazir on all occasions which he promised to do after this the king returned to his city and sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array so they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen besides footmen and camp followers then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled whilst sharrkan mounted horse with the wazir dandan by his side and the colours fluttering over their heads so the host fared forth and stinted not faring with the ambassadors preceding them till day departed and night drew nigh when they alighted and encamped for the night and as soon as allah caused the morn tomorrow they mounted and tried on guided by the ambassadors for a space of twenty days and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious wady well grown with trees and shrubbery here sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt so they dismounted and pitched their tents spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley whilst the wazir dandan and the ambassadors of king afridun pitched in the sole of the wady as for sharrkan he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides he then slacked the reins of his steed being minded to explore the wady and to mount guard in his own person because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of graecia land and in the enemy's country so he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the wazir dandan and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him so that he could no longer urge horse with heel now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback so when slumber overpowered him he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets which was dense with growth but sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons eastern and western he was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great but as he rode on in fear of wild beasts behold the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of paradise and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men so king sharrkan alighted and tying his steed to one of the trees went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in arabic and saying now by the crush of the messiah this is not well of you but whose utters a word i will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle he kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold a stream was gushing and flowing and antelopes at large were frisking and roving and wild cattle amid the pasture moving and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs even as a poet described it in these coupletsmost beautiful is earth in budding bloom  when lucid waters course through plain and woodno work but his th' all great th' all glorious  giver of all gifts giver of all goodand as sharrkan considered the place he saw in it a christian monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon through the midst of the convent passed a stream the water flowing amongst its gardens and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder high bosomed virgins as saith of them the poet in these coupletsthe mead is bright with what is on't  of merry maidens debonnairdouble its beauty and its grace  those trooping damsels slender fairvirgins of graceful swimming gait  ready with eye and lip to ensnareand like the tendril'd vine they loose  the rich profusion of their hairshooting their shafts and arrows from  beautiful eyes beyond compareoverpowering and transpiercing  every froward adversairesharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright and temple locks like the scorpion's tail and she was perfect in essence and attributes as the poet said of her in these coupletsshe beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance  and her straight slender stature enshamed the lanceshe burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red  where all manner of beauties have habitanceand the locks on her forehead were lowering as night  whence issues a dawn tide of happiest chancethen sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids come ye on that i may wrestle with you and gravel you ere the moon set and the dawn break so each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright and pinioned them with their girdles and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all then there turned to her an old woman who was before her and the beldam said as in wrath o strumpet cost thou glory in grounding these girls behold i am an old woman yet have i thrown them forty times so what hast thou to boast of but if thou have the strength to wrestle with me stand up that i may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels the young lady smiled at her words but she was filled with inward wrath and she jumped up and asked o my lady zat aldawahi by the truth of the messiah wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed or dost thou jest with me and she answered yeaand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the fortyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the young lady asked zat aldawahi by the truth of the messiah wilt wrestle with me or dost jest and she answered yea i will wrestle with thee in very deed sharrkan looking on the while the damsel cried rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do when the old woman heard this she raged with exceeding rage and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog then she sprang to her feet whilst the damsel stood up to her and said now by the truth of the messiah i will not wrestle with thee unless i be naked mistress whore so she loosed her petticoat trousers and putting her hand under her clothes tore them off her body then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head if ritah or a spotted snake with this she inclined towards the damsel and said do thou as i have done all this time sharrkan was gazing at the twain and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance so the damsel leisurely rose and taking a sash of yamani stuff passed it twice round her waist then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal smooth and rounded and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples as it were a bed of nu'uman's anemones and breasts like double pomegranates then the old woman leant towards her and the two laid hold either of each while sharrkan raised his head heavenwards and prayed allah that the belle might beat the beldam presently the young woman get beneath the old woman and gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand hoisted her off the ground with both whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and in so doing fell on her back arsiversy with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine furthermore she let fly two great farts one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of heaven sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground then he arose and baring his brand looked right and left but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back and said to himself he lied not who named thee lady of calamities verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others so he drew near them to hear what should pass between them then the young lady went up to the old one and throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying o my lady zat al dawahi i intended only to throw thee and not all this but thou triedst to twist out of my hands so laud to allah for safety she returned her no answer but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned with the fair damsel standing amongst them quoth sharrkan to himself every luck hath its cause sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me so he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled him on when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath which he brandished shouting the while his war cry allah is all mighty when the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and taking firm stand on the bank of the stream whose breadth was six ells the normal cubits made one bound and landed clear on the farther side where she turned and cried out with a loud voice who art thou o thou fellow that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host whence camest thou and whither art thou going speak sooth for truth will stand thee in good stead and lie not for lies come of villein breed doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies for thou art now in an open plain and did we shout but a single shout would come to our rescue four thousand knights so tell me what thou wantest and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road we will do so when sharrkan heard her words he replied i am a stranger of the moslems who fared forth this night single handed seeking for spoil nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens so i shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them quoth she i would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it and as for the handmaids by allah they shall never be thy spoil have i not told thee that to lie is villein vile quoth he the wise man is he who taketh warning by others thereupon quoth she by the truth of the messiah did i not fear that thy death would be on my hands i would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might but i take pity upon the stranger so if thou seek booty i require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me by thy faith that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand and we will wrestle i and thou if thou throw me set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty but if i throw thee thou shalt become under my command swear this to me for i fear thy treachery indeed it hath become a common saw 'where perfidy is innate there trust is a weakly mate' now an thou wilt swear i will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee answered sharrkan and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul truly she knoweth not that i am a champion of champions swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding and i will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest 'draw near that i wrestle with thee' if thou throw me i have money where withal to ransom myself and if i throw thee 'twill be booty and booty enough for me rejoined the damsel i am content herewith and sharrkan was astounded at her words and said and by the truth of the apostle whom allah bless and keep i too am content on the other part then said she swear to me by him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling else mayst thou die without the pale of al islam sharrkan replied by allah were a kazi to swear me even though he were a kazi of the kazis he would not impose upon me such an oath as this then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree but he was drowned in the sea of thought saying in himself praise be to him who fashioned her from dirty water then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling and said to her cross the stream to me but she replied it is not for me to come over to thee if thou wilt pass thou over here to me i cannot do that quoth he and quoth she o boy i will come across to thee so she tucked up her skirts and leaping landed on the other side of the stream by his side whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms but he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness for he saw a shape which the hand of power had tanned with the dye leaves of the jann which had been fostered by the hand of beneficence and fanned by the zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted then she called out to him o moslem come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd which illumined the whole place with its whiteness and sharrkan was dazzled by it then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge she doing the like and caught hold of her and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle breeding languishment and he fell a trembling like the persian reed in the roaring gale so she lifted him up and throwing him to the ground sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand for his soul had lost mastery over his senses then she asked him o moslem the slaying of nazarenes is lawful to you folk what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself and he answered o my lady thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful for our prophet mohammed whom allah bless and preserve prohibited the slaying of women and children old men and monks as it was thus revealed to your prophet she replied it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy so rise i give thee thy life for generosity is never lost upon the generous then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib even women and she said to him be not ashamed but verily one who entereth the land of roum in quest of booty and cometh to assist kings against kings how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib 'twas not for lack of strength in me he answered nor didst thou throw me by thy force it was thy loveliness overthrew me so if thou wilt grant me another bout it will be of thy courtesy she laughed and said i grant thee thy request but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary and it were only right i should loose them for haply this next wrestling bout will be long then she went to the slave girls and unbinding them said to them in the tongue of greece get ye to some safe place till i foil this moslem's lust and longing for you so they went away whilst sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers but when he felt waist touch waist his strength failed him and she waxing ware of this lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding levenflash and threw him to the ground he fell on his back and then she said to him rise i give thee thy life a second time i spared thee in the first count because of thy prophet for that he made unlawful the slaying of women and i do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood but i charge thee if there be in the moslem army sent by omar bin alnu'uman to succour the king of constantinople a stronger than thou send him hither and tell him of me for in wrestling there are shifts and trips catches and holds such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip the hug the feetcatch the thigh lite the jostle and the leglock by allah o my lady quoth sharrkan and indeed he was highly incensed against her had i been master alsafd master mohammed kiml or ibn alsadd as they were in their prime i had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest for o my mistress by allah thou hast not grassed me by thy strength but by the blandishments of thy back parts for we men of mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight but now an thou wish thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three moreover i have regained my presence of mind when she heard his words she said to him hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling o vanquished one however come on an thou wilt but know that this must be the last round then she bent forward and challenged him and sharrkan did likewise setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him o moslem thou art now on thy mettle yes he replied thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round after which each of us will wend a different way she laughed and he laughed too then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back she laughed at him and said art thou an eater of bran thou are like a badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the father of winds that droppeth before a puff of air fie upon thee o thou poor thing adding get thee back to the moslem army and send us other than thyself for thou fairest of thews and proclaim for us among the arabs and persians the turks and daylamites whoso hath might in him let him come to us then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to sharrkan laughing parting with thee is right grievous to me o my lord but get thee to thy mates before dawn lest the knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and knights sharrkan was confounded and called to her as she turned from him making towards the convent o my lady wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger the broken hearted slave of love so she turned to him laughing and said what is thy want i will grant thee thy prayer have i set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy replied he and shall i return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality i who have become one of thy servitors none baulk kindliness save the base she rejoined honour us in allah's name on my head and eyes be it mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me for now thou art my guest at this sharrkan was glad and hastening back to his horse mounted and walked him abreast of her and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge built of beams of the white poplar hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks when sharrkan looked he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts and as she came up to them she said to one in the greek tongue arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent so she went up to sharrkan and led him over much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw and saying to himself o would that the wazir dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours then he turned to the young lady and said to her o marvel of loveliness now i have two claims upon thee first the claim of good fellowship and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality i am now under thy commandance and thy guidance so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of alislam where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who i am when she heard this she was angered and said to him by the truth of the messiah thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit but now i see what mischief there is in thy heart and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent how should i do as thou sayest when i wot that if i came to that king of yours omar bin al nu'uman i should never get free from him for truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls lord of baghdad and of khorasan though he be who hath built for himself twelve pavilions in number as the months of the year and in each a concubine after the number of the days and if i come to him he would not prove shy of me for your folk believe i am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ 'or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves' so how canst thou speak thus to me as for thy saying 'thou shalt look upon the braves of the moslems' by the truth of the messiah thou sayest that which is not true for i saw your army when it reached our land these two days ago and i did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of kings but i beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together and as to thy words 'thou shalt know who i am' i did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me even wert thou sharrkan omar bin al nu'uman's son the prowess name in these days knowest thou sharrkan asked he and she answered yes and i know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the king of constantinople o my lady said sharrkan i adjure thee by thy religion tell me the cause of all this that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth and with whom the fault lies now by the virtue of thy faith she replied did i not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that i am of the daughters of roum i would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader the wazir dandan and vanquish their champion sharrkan nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby for i have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the arabs but i have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women nor indeed had sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him 'clear this stream' could he have done it and i only long and lust that the messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent that i might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the fortyeighth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the nazarene damsel said to sharrkan and he listening impatiently enow verily if sharrkan fell into my hands i would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeatingan faulty of one fault the beauty prove  her charms a thousand advocates shall moveso she went up and sharrkan after her and when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other like rollers in the rolling sea he extemporised these couplets for her sins is a pleader that brow  and all hearts its fair pleading must bowwhen i saw it i cried to night  the moon at its fullest doth showtho' balkis' own ifrit try a bout  spite his force she would deal him a throwthe two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway this she opened and ushered sharrkan into a long vestibule vaulted with ten connected arches from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire the handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems and went on before her sharrkan still following till they reached the inner convent there the moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold the monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold whence the water ran like molten silver whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for kings then said the damsel ascend o my lord this throne so he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him she hath gone to her dormitory but we will serve thee even as she ordered so they set before him viands of rare varieties and he ate his sufficiency when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver and he washed his hands then his thoughts reverted to his army knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions so he was troubled about his case repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeatedi am not lost to prudence but indeed  here i'm bewildered what shall be my redewould any aid me in mine ails of love  by my own might and sleight would i be free'dbut ah my heart is lost and passionshent  to none save allah can i trust my needwhen he ended his verse behold there came up to him a rare show and a fair more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her she was clad in brocades befitting kings her breasts were like twin pomegranates a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal supporting a silvern shaft when sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight and he forgot army and wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead he sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness and cried aloud beware and beware of that zone rarely fair and broke out into these coupletswith heavy back parts high breasts delicate  and lissome form that sways with swimming gaitshe deftly hides love longing in her breast  but i may never hide its ban and batewhile hosts of followers her steps precede  like pearls now necklaced and now separateshe gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him when she came up to him and said in very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee o sharrkan how sped thy night o hero after we went away and left thee adding verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful especially in great kings and thou art crown prince sharrkan son and heir of king omar bin alnu'uman so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite and as thou art pierced by the shaft of fate be resignation thine and abide content to wait when he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth saying i am sharrkan bin omar bin alnu'uman whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place so whatso thou willest do it in my case she hung her head groundwards a long while then turned to him and said be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear for thou art the guest of my hospitality and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard have no fear for by the truth of the messiah if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee till life had left my body for thy sake indeed thou art now under the charge of the messiah and of me hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him she would have done so during the past night presently she bespoke in the grecian tongue one of her slave girls who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food but sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself haply she hath put somewhat in this meat she knew what was in his thought so she turned to him and said by the truth of the messiah the case is not on such wise nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest had my mind been set on slaying thee i had slain thee ere now then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful where upon sharrkan came forward and ate too she was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied they washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour wines of all colours and kinds and a wineservice with vessels of gold silver and crystal she filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him even as she had done with the food then she crowned a second and handed it to him he drank and she said to him o moslem see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life and she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink till he took leave of his wits and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the fortyninth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her presently she said to the slave girl o marjanah bring us some instruments of music to hear is to obey said the hand maid and going out returned in the twinkling of an eye with a damascus lute a persian harp a tartar pipe and an egyptian dulcimer the young lady took the lute and after tuning each several string began in gentle undersong to sing softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than tasmin spring with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets followingallah assain those eyne what streams of blood they shed  how many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have spedi love all lovers who to lovers show them cure  'twere wrong to rue the love in wrong head born and bredhaply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens  heaven help the hapless heart by force of thee misledthou doomest me to death who art my king and i  ransom with life the deemster who would doom me deadthereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument played and recited couplets in the roumi tongue then their mistress sang also and seeing sharrkan in ecstasies asked him o moslem dost thou understand what i say and he answered nay my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips she laughed and continued if i sing to thee in arabic what wouldst thou do i should no longer quoth he be master of my senses then she took an instrument and changing the measure began singing these versesthe smack of parting's myrrh to me  how then bear patience' aloi'm girt by ills in trinity  severance distance crueltymy freedom stole that fairest she  and parting irks me bitterlywhen she ended her verse she looked at sharrkan and found him lost to existence and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens then he revived and remembering the songs again inclined to mirth and merriment and the twain returned to their wine and wassail and continued their playing and toying their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when sharrkan asked after her they answered she is gone to her sleeping chamber whereto he rejoined under allah's ward and his good guard as soon as it was morning a handmaid came to him and said to him my mistress biddeth thee to her so he rose and followed her and as he drew near her lodging the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams about the saloon were figures carved in human form and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within so that the beholder would fancy they spoke here sat the young lady looking at the figures but when she saw sharrkan she sprang to her feet and taking him by the hand made him sit down by her side and asked him how he had passed the night he blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love and he answered yes i wot somewhat in verse on that matter let me hear it quoth she so he began quotingpleasure and health good cheer good appetite  to azzah freest with our name and fameby allah would i near her off she flies  at tangent granting less the more i claimi dote on azzah but when clear i off  my rivals clears me too that dearest damelike wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud  which ere siesta done thin air becamewhen she heard this she said verily alkuthayyir was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste and he was superlative in his praise of azzah when he sang and she began to recitedid azzah deal behest to sun o' noon  the judge had judged her beauty's bestest boonand girls who come to me and carp at her  god make their rosy cheeks her sandalshoonand indeed quoth she 'twas said that azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness then she asked sharrkan saying o prince cost thou know aught of jamil's verses to buthaynah if so repeat to us somewhat of them and he answered yes i know them better than any whereupon he began repeating these coupletsjamil in holy war go fight to me they say  what war save fight for fair ones would i e'er essayto me their every word and work are mere delight  and martyrs crepe i all they slay in fight and frayan ask i 'o buthaynah what's this love i pray  which eats my heart' quoth she ' 'twill stay for ever and aye'and when i cry 'of wits return some small display  for daily use' quoth she 'far far 'tis fled awaythou seekst my death naught else thy will can satisfy  while i no goal espy save thee and thee alway'thou hast spoken right well said she o king's son and jamil also spoke excellently well but what would buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich'thou seekst my death naught else thy will can satisfy'o my lady quoth sharrkan she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me and even that will not satisfy thee she laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till day put out her light and night came in darkness dight then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept while sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned as soon as he awoke the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment as wont and kissing the ground between his hands said to him bismillah in allah's name be so kind as to come our mistress biddeth thee to her presence so he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him playing on tabrets and other instruments of music till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts passing all description sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began recitinghe plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry  and her breast pearls that bedded in gold mine liepure water on silvern bars is her brow  and her cheeks show roses with rubies viemeseems in her eyne that the violet's hue  lies purpling set in the ithmid's dyewhen the lady saw sharrkan she stood up to him in honour andtaking his hand seated him by her side and asked o son of kingomar bin alnu'uman hast thou any cunning in the game of chessyes he answered but do not thou with me as said the poet'i speak and longing love upties me and unties me  till with her honey dew of inner lip she plies mei brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me  with white and black but black cum white ne'er satisfies me'twas as if king for castle i were fain to place me  till wilful loss of game atwixt two queens surprise meand if i seek to read intent in eyes that eye me  oh man that glance askance with hint of wish defies me'then she brought the chessboard and played with him but sharrkan instead of looking at her moves kept gazing at her fair mouth and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant instead of knight she laughed and said to him if thy play be after this fashion thou knowest naught of the game this is only our first replied he judge not by this bout when she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her but she beat him a second time a third a fourth and a fifth so she turned to him and said thou art beaten in everything and he replied o my lady how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten then she bade bring food and they ate and washed their hands after which the wine was set before them and they drank presently she took the dulcimer for her hand was cunning in smiting it and she began repeating to an accompaniment these coupletstwixt the close tied and open wide no medium fortune knoweth  now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness showeththen drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost find her  anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good forth goeththey ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first when darkness set in the lady betook her to her dormitory leaving him alone with the hand maids so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up and they carried him to their mistress who came to meet him and taking him by the hand seated him by her side then she asked him how he had passed his night whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvisedne'er incline thee to part  which embitters the hearte'en the sun when he sets  shall in pallor departwhile they were solacing themselves after this fashion behold there arose a great and sudden clamour and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands and cried aloud in the grecian tongue thou hast fallen into our hands o sharrkan so make thee sure of death when he heard this he said to himself by allah she hath entrapped me and held me in play till her men should come these are the knights with whom she threatened me but 'tis i who have thrown myself into this strait then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd who are ye o most gracious princess and peerless onion pearl answered the leading knight dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side not i she replied who may he be quoth the patrician this is of towns the highwayman this is he who rideth in the horseman's van this is sharrkan son of king omar bin alnu'uman this is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place the news of him reached king hardub thy father by report of the ancient dame zat al dawahi and thy sire our sovereign hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the greeks by taking captive this ominous lion when she heard this she looked at the knight and asked him what be thy name and he answered i am msrah son of thy slave mausrah bin kshardah knight of knights and how quoth she durst thou enter my presence without leave quoth he o my lady when i came to the gate none forbade me neither chamberlain nor porter but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont although when others come they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them but this is not a time for long talking when the king is expecting our return with this prince the scorpion sting of the islamitic host that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came without the bane of battling with them these words be ill words rejoined the princess and dame zat aldawahi lied avouching an idle thing and a vain whereof she weeteth not the truth for by the virtue of the messiah this man who is with me is not sharrkan nor is he a captive but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality and i made him my guest so even were we assured that this be sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt i say it would ill befit mine honour that i should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection so make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men but return to the king my father and kiss the ground before him and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the lady zat aldawahi o abrzah replied masurah the knight i cannot return to the king's majesty without his debtor and enemy quoth she and indeed she had waxed very wroth out on thee return to him with my answer and no blame shall befal thee quoth masurah i will not return without him thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed exceed not in talk and vain words for verily this man had not come in to us were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders and if i said to him 'thou art sharrkan son of king omar bin alnu'uman' he would answer 'yes' but 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him for if you do so he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place behold here he is by my side and i will bring him before you sword and targe in hand albeit i were safe from thy wrath answered masurah the knight i am not safe from that of thy father and when i see him i shall sign to the knights to take him captive and we will carry him to the king bound and in abject sort when she heard this she said the matter shall not pass thus for 'twould be blazoning mere folly this man is but one and ye are an hundred knights so if you would attack him come out against him one after one that it may appear to the king which is the valiant amongst youand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the fiftieth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that princess abrizah said to the knight this man is but one and ye are an hundred so if ye would attack him come out against him one after one that it may appear to the king which is the valiant quoth masurah the knight by the truth of the messiah thou sayest sooth and none but i shall sally out against him first quoth she wait till i go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make if he consent 'tis well but if he refuse ye shall on no wise come to him for i and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom so she went to sharrkan and told him the news whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the emirs but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad till the report reached the king against her wish and intent so he again began reproaching himself and said how came i to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the greeks but hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her indeed their onset one after one would be overburdensome to them will they not come out against me ten by ten that would be villainy said she let one have at one when he heard this he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear and masurah the knight also sprang up and bore down upon him sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut which clove him to the middle and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels when the lady beheld that swashingblow sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness so she turned to the knights and said take wreak for your chief thereupon out came the slain man's brother a fierce and furious knight and rushed upon sharrkan who delayed not but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals then cried the princess o ye servants of the messiah avenge your comrade so they ceased not charging down upon him one after one and sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade till he had slain fifty knights the lady looking on the while and allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello but fell upon him in a body and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled till he had driven sense and soul out of them then the princess called aloud to her damsels saying who is left in the convent and they replied none but the gate keepers whereupon she went up to sharrkan and took him to her bosom he doing the same and they returned to the palace after he had made an end of the melee now there remained a few of the knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery and when the princess saw this she rose from sharrkan's side and left him for a while but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine indian scymitar and she said now by the truth of the messiah i will not be a niggard of myself for my guest nor will i abandon him though for this i abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the greeks then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the knights and other twenty had taken to flight when she saw what work he had made with them she said to him allah bless thee o sharrkan the cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these coupletshow oft in the mellay i've cleft the array  and given their bravest to lions a preyask of me and of them when i proved me prow  o'er creation on days of the foray and fraywhen i left in the onslaught their lions to lie  on the sands of the low lands in fieriest daywhen he ended his verse the princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her o lady mine wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand to guard thee against these caitiffs she replied then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them how came ye to admit the king's knights into my dwelling without leave of me and they answered o princess it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the king's messengers and especially for the chief of his knights quoth she i think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest and bade sharrkan smite their necks he did so and she cried to the rest of her servants of a truth they deserved even more than that then turning to sharrkan she said to him now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed thou shalt be made acquainted with my history know then that i am the daughter of king hardub of roum my name is abrizah and the ancient dame yclept zat aldawahi is my grandmother by the sword side she it certainly is who told my father of thee and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that i have separated myself from the nazarenes and have become no better than i should be with the moslems wherefore it were wiser that i leave this dwelling while zat aldawahi is on my track but i require of thee the like kindness and courtesy i have shown thee for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account so do not thou neglect to do aught that i shall say to thee remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee hearing her words sharrkan joyed greatly his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight and he said by allah none shall come at thee while life is in my bosom but hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people even so she answered and sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth then said she now is my heart at ease but there remaineth one other condition for thee what is it asked he and she answered it is that thou return with thy host to thine own country quoth he o lady mine my father king omar bin al nu'uman sent me to wage war upon thy sire on account of the treasure he plundered from the king of constantinople and amongst the rest three great jewels noted givers of good fortune quoth she cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes i will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the king of constantinople know that we have a yearly festival highs the convent feast whereat kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families and the visitors abide there seven days i was wont to be one of them but when there befel enmity between us my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years one year it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron as was their custom came a daughter of the king of constantinople a beautiful girl called sophia they tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways but sophia said 'i will not return to constantinople save by water' so they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite and making sail they put out to sea but as they were voyaging behold a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till as fate and fortune would have it she fell in with a nazarene craft from the camphor island carrying a crew of five hundred armed franks who had been cruising about a long time when they sighted the sails of the ship wherein sophia and her women were they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and splitting their sails drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast thereupon we sallied forth and looking on them as spoil driven to us by fate boarded and took them and slaying the men made prize of the wreck wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens amongst whom was the king's daughter sophia after the capture we carried the princess and her women to my father not knowing her to be a daughter of king afridun of constantinople and he chose out for himself ten including her and divided the rest among his dependents presently he set apart five damsels amongst whom was the king s daughter and sent them to thy father king omar bin alnu'uman together with other gifts such as broadcloth and woollen stuffs and grecian silks thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls sophia daughter of king afridun nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat rebuking him with menaces and saying to him two years ago you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of frankish pirates in which was my daughter sophia attended by her maidens numbering some threescore yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise nor could i make the matter public lest reproach befal me amongst the kings by reason of my daughter's honour so i concealed my case till this year when i wrote to certain frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the kings of the isles they replied 'by allah we carried her not forth of thy realm but we have heard that king hardub rescued her from certain pirates and they told me the whole tale' then he added in the writing which he writ to my father 'except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter you will the instant my letter reacheth you send my daughter back to me but if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment i will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices' when my father read this letter and understood the contents it vexed him and he regretted not having known that sophia king afridun's daughter was among the captured damsels that he might have sent her back to her sire and he was perplexed about the case because after so long a time he could not send to king omar bin alnu'uman and demand her back from him especially as he had lately heard that heaven had granted him boon of babe by this sophia so when we pondered that truth we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to king afridun making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to king omar bin al nu'uman who had gotten the blessing of issue by her when my father's reply reached king afridun he rose up and sat down and roared and foamed at the mouth crying'what shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to kings and they lie with her without marriage contract by the messiah and the true faith' said he 'i will not desist till i have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame and indeed i will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me' so he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares when he sent an embassy to thy father king omar to tell him that which thou hast heard accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to king afridun whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot as for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid there was not one soothfast word in that matter for they were with sophia his daughter and my father took them from her when he got possession of her and of her maidens and gave them to me in free gift and they are now with me so go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into and shut in by the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the franks and the country of the greeks for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the day of retribution and retaliation i know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them because thou didst order a three days' rest withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do when sharrkan heard her words he was absent awhile in thought then he kissed princess abrizah's hand and said praise be to allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me but 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and i know not what will become of thee after my departure go now to thine army she replied and turn them back while ye are yet near your own country if the envoys be still with them lay hands on them and keep them that the case may be made manifest to you and after three days i will be with you all and we will enter baghdad together as he turned to depart she said forget not the compact which is between me and thee then she rose to bid him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire so she took leave of him and throwing her arms round his neck wept with exceeding weeping and repeated these versesi bade adieu my right hand wiped my tears away  the while my left hand held her in a close embrace'fearest thou naught' quoth she 'of shame' i answered 'nay  the lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace'then sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent they brought his steed so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow as soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert and he bared his brand and rode cautiously but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold it was the wazir dandan and two of his emirs when they saw him and knew him they dismounted and saluting him asked the reason of his absence whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and princess abrizah from first to last the wazir returned thanks to almighty allah for his safety and said let us at once leave these lands for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the king of our approach and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners so sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount which they did and setting out at once they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay the ambassadors meanwhile had reported sharrkan's approach to their king who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him but sharrkan escorted by the wazir dandan and the two emirs had no sooner sighted the army than he raised the cry march march they took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day nor did they cease faring for five days at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley where they rested awhile then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country here deeming themselves safe they halted to rest and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts they tarried there two days after which as all would be making for their homes sharrkan put the wazir dandan in command bidding him lead the host back to baghdad but he himself remained behind with an hundred riders till the rest of the army had made one day's march then he called to horse and mounted with his hundred men they rode on two parasangs' space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust so they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers lion faced and in mail coats cased as soon as they drew within earshot of sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them saying by the virtue of john and mary we have won to our wish we have been following you by forced marches night and day till we forewent you to this place so dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves that we may grant you your lives when sharrkan heard this his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'how is it o nazarene dogs ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land and doth not this suffice you but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country then he shouted to his hundred horsemen up and at these hounds for they even you in number so saying he bared his sabre and bore down on them he and his but the franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks and wight dashed against wight and knight dashed upon knight and hot waxed the fight and sore was the affright and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight and they stinted not to charge and to smite right hand meeting right nor to hack and hew with blades bright white till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight then they drew apart and sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only who showed hurts but not death hurts said he to them by allah my life long have i waded in the clashing sea of fight and i have met many a gallant sprite but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant knights know o king said they that there is among them a frankish cavalier who is their leader and indeed he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust but by allah he spares us great and small for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him by allah had he willed he had killed us all sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the knight had done and such high report of him so he said when the morn shall morrow we will draw out and defy them for we are an hundred to their hundred and we will seek aid against them from the lord of the heavens so they rested that night in such intent whilst the franks gathered round their captain and said verily this day we did not win our will of these and he replied at early dawn when the morrow shall morn we will draw out and challenge them one after one they also rested in that mind and both camps kept guard until almighty allah sent the light of day dawn thereupon king sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain where they found the franks ranged in line of battle and sharrkan said to his followers our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir so up and at them and lay on load then came forth an herald of the franks and cried out saying let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day save by the duello a champion of yours against a champion of ours whereupon one of sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying ho who is for smiting let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling hardly had he made an end of his vaunt when there sallied forth to him a frankish cavalier armed cappie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff riding on a grey white steed and he had no hair on his cheeks he urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust but it was not long before the frank foined the moslem with the lance point and toppling him from his steed took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen his folk rejoiced in their comrade and forbidding him to go out again to the field sent forth another to whom sallied out another moslem brother to the captive and offered him battle the two fell to either against other and fought for a little while till the frank bore down upon the moslem and falsing him with a feint tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner after this fashion the moslems ceased not dashing forwards one after one and the franks to unhorse them and take them captive till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted now they had captured of the moslems twenty cavaliers and when sharrken saw this it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them what is this thing that hath befallen us to morrow i myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band if he persist we will punish him with death and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him they righted on this wise till allah almighty caused the morn to dawn when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain and sharrkan was going forth to the plain but behold more than one half of the franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted till they reached the midst of the battle plain sharrken looked at that horseman and lo he was their chief he was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks he hent in hand an indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow like a dirham and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when signing to the moslems he cried out in fluent arab speech ho sharrkan ho son of omar bin al nu'uman ho thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries up and out to battle bout and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field thou art prince of thy people and i am prince of mine and whoso overcometh his adversary him let the other's men obey and come under his sway hardly had he ended his speech when out came sharrkan with a heart full of fury and urging his steed into the midst of the field closed like a raging lion with the frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors then they fell to foining and hewing and they stinted not of onset and offset and give and take as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened then they drew apart and each returned to his own party but as soon as sharrkan foregathered with his comrades he said never looked i on the like of this cavalier he hath one quality i have not yet seen in any and this it is that when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lanceheel in very deed i know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men then he went to his rest for the night and when morning dawned the frank came forth and rode down to the mid field where sharrkan met him and they fell to fighting and to wheeling left and right and necks were stretched out to see the sight nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello and at last the frank said to his men tomorrow shall decide the matter so they both passed that night restfully till dawn and as soon as it was day they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done then the frank bethought him of a ruse first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein so that he stumbled and fell with his rider thereupon sharrkan threw himself on the foe and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged when the frank cried out to him o sharrkan champions are not wont to do thus this is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman when sharrkan heard this he raised his eyes to the frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him recognized in him princess abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent whereupon he cast brand from hand and kissing the earth before her asked her what moved thee to a deed like this and she answered i desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting these that are with me are my handmaids and they are all clean maids yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain and had not my steed stumbled with me thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat sharrkan smiled at her speech and said praise be to allah for safety and for my reunion with thee o queen of the age then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of sharrkan's troop and dismount they did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and sharrkan who said to them it is the like of you that kings keep in store for the need hour then he signed to his comrades to salute the princess so all alighted and kissed the earth before her for they knew the story after this the whole two hundred took horse and fared on night and day for six days' space till they drew near to baghdad when they halted and sharrkan bade abrizah and her handmaids doff the frankish garb that was on themand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the fiftyfirst nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan bade princess abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of greece and thus did they then he despatched a company of his companions to baghdad to acquaint his father omar bin alnu'uman with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by princess abrizah daughter of king hardub lord of graecialand they halted forthright in the place they had reached and sharrkan also halted and all righted there and when almighty allah made morning dawn sharrkan and his company and abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city when lo on the way they met the wazir dandan who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour abrizah and sharrkan by especial commandment of king omar son of al nu'uman when the two drew near they turned towards them and kissed ground before them then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace sharrkan walked in to his father who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case so he told him all that abrizah had told him and what had passed between them and said she hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us and indeed he said to his father the king of constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief because of his daughter sophia for that the king of greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee and he the grecian king not knowing her to be daughter of king afridun lord of constantinople and had he known that he would not have bestowed her upon thee but he would have restored her to her parent and of a verity he continued we were saved from these perils only by the lady abrizah and never saw we a more valiant than she and he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting when king omar heard the story of sharrkan abrizah was exalted in his eyes and he longed to see her and question her thereupon sharrkan went out to her and said the king calleth for thee she replied i hear and i obey and he took her and brought her in to his father who was seated on his throne and who having dismissed his high officers was attended only by his eunuchs the princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands saluted him in choice terms he was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son sharrkan and bade her be seated so she sat down and unveiled her face and when the king saw her beauty his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels and assigning them solde and allowances then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid and she answered here be they with me o king of the age so saying she rose and going to her lodging unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold she opened the casket and taking out those three jewels kissed them and gave them to the king then she went away bearing his heart with her after her going the king sent for his son sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three and when he enquired of the other two replied o my son i mean to give one to thy brother zau almakan and the other to thy sister nuzhat al zaman but when sharrkan heard that he had a brother for to that time he knew only of his sister he turned to his sire and said to him o king hast thou a son other than myself he answered yes and he is now six years old adding that his name was zau al makan and that he and nuzhat alzaman were twins born at a birth this news was grievous to sharrkan but he kept his secret and said the bless ing of allah most high be upon them and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes quoth the king how do i see thee change thy manner when hearing of this considering that after me thou becomes heir of the kingdom of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the emirs and grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee and this one of the three jewels is thine sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath and stayed not walking till he had entered abrizah's palace as he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire then she sat down and seated him by her side but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him whereupon he told her that allah had blessed his father with two children by sophia a boy and a girl and that he had named the boy zau almakan and the girl nuzhat alzaman adding he hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine so i left it behind i knew naught of zau almakan's birth till this day and the twain are now six years old so when i learnt this wrath possessed me and i tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee but now i fear lest my father take thee to wife for he loveth thee and i saw in him signs of desire for thee so what wilt thou say if he wish this quoth she know o sharrkan that thy father hath no dominion over me nor can he have me without my consent and if he prevail over me by force i will take my own life as for the three jewels it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and i had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price but now i desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee if thou have accepted it hearkening and obedience replied sharrkan and gave it to her then said she fear nothing and talked with him awhile and continued i fear lest my father hear that i am with you and sit not patiently under my loss but do his endeavours to find me and to that end he may ally himself with king afridun on account of his daughter sophia and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil when sharrken heard these words he said to her o my lady if it please thee to sojourn with us take no thought of them though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea  'tis well rejoined she if ye entreat me fair i will tarry with you and if ye deal evilly by me i will depart from you then she bade her slave maidens bring food so they set the tables and sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house disturbed and perturbed such was his case but regarding the affairs of his father omar bin alnu'uman after dismissing his son sharrkan he arose and taking the other two jewels betook himself to the lady sophia who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated presently his two children zau almakan and nuzhat alzaman came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands then went they to their mother who joyed in their joy and wished the king long life so he asked her why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of king afridun lord of constantinople that i might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank o king answered sophia and what could i desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee overwhelmed as i am with thy favours and thy benefits and furthermore allah hath blessed me with two children by thee a son and a daughter her reply pleased the king and after leaving her he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace moreover he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment and presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his court where he distributed justice among the lieges so far concerning him and sophia and her children but in the matter of abrizah the king was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day and every night he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her but she gave him no answer only saying o king of the age i have no desire for men at this present when he saw her withdraw from him his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until when weary of this he summoned his wazir dandan and opening his very heart to him told him of his love for princess abrizah daughter of hardub and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die for that he could get no grace of her the wazir hearing these words said to the king as soon as it is dark night take thou a piece of bhang the measure of a miskal about an ounce and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her when the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near fill her a last cup and dropping therein the bhang give it to her to drink and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her and such is my advice thy rede is aright quoth the king and seeking his treasury he took thence a piece of concentrated bhang if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year this he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by when he betook himself to the palace of princess abrizah who seeing him stood up to receive him but he bade her sit down so she sat down and he sat by her and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail whereupon she furnished the carousing table and placed it before him then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking so they fell to tippling and the king ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head and seeing this he took out the bit of bhang from his pocket and holding it between his fingers filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off then filling a second he said to thy companionship and dropped the drug into her cup she knowing naught of it she took it and drank it off then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber he waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs when the king saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and satan seduced him and he could not master himself but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head then he rose off her and went to one of her women by name marjnah and said go in to thy lady and speak with her so she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible with the blood running down to the calves of her legs whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night as soon as almighty allah brought the dawn the handmaid marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of bhang like a bolus then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to marjanah tell me what hath befallen me so she told her what had passed and how she had found her lying on her back with the blood running down wherefore she knew that king omar bin alnu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her at this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy saying to her damsels deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that i am ill till i see what allah will do with me presently the news of her sickness came to the king so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries some months she thus passed in solitude during which time the king's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched so that he abstained from her now she had conceived by him and when the months of child breeding had gone by her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled and the world was straitened upon her so she said to her handmaid marjanah know that it is not the folk who have wronged me but i who sinned against my own self in that i left my father and mother and country indeed i abhor life for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me i used when i mounted my steed to have the mastery of him but now i am unable to ride if i be brought to bed among them i shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame and if i return to my father with what face shall i meet him or with what face shall i have recourse to him how well quoth the poet'say what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead  nor cup companion nor a cup nor place to house his head'marjanah answered her it is thine to command i will obey and abrizah said i desire at once to leave this place secretly so that none shall know of me but thou and return to my father and my mother for when flesh stinketh there is naught for it but its own folk and allah shall do with me e'en as he will o princess marjanah replied what thou wouldest do is well then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the king went out to chase and hunt and his son sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile then said she to marjanah i wish to set out this night but how shall i do against my destiny for already i feel the pangs of labour and child birth and if i abide other four or five days i shall be brought to bed here and i shall be unable to travel to my country but this is what was written on my forehead then she considered awhile and said to marjanah look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way for i have no strength to bear arms by allah o my lady replied marjanah i know none but a black slave called al ghazbn who is one of the slaves of king omar bin al nu'uman he is a valiant wight and he keepeth guard at our palace gate the king appointed him to attend us and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours so lookye i will go out and speak with him of this matter and promise him some monies and tell him that if he have a mind to tarry with us i will marry him to whom he will he told me before to day that he had been a highwayman so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land she rejoined call him that i may talk with him whereupon marjanah fared forth and said to the slave 'o ghazban allah prosper thee so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee then she took him by the hand and brought him to the princess whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him her heart took fright at him how ever she said to herself of a truth need giveth the law and she approached to speak with him yet her heart started away from him presently she said o ghazban say me wilt thou help me against the perfidies of fortune and conceal my secret if i discover it to thee when the slave saw her his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply o my mistress whatsoever thou biddest me do i will not depart therefrom quoth she i would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the king's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt and go with us to our own country where if thou desire to abide with us i will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens or if thou prefer return to thine own land we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee when al ghazban heard this he rejoiced with great joy and replied o my lady i will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses then he went away gladsome and saying to himself i shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me i will kill them both and take their riches but he kept this his intent to himself and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses one of which he rode and princess abrizah made marjanah mount the second she mounting the third albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish and the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country when the travail pangs came upon abrizah and she could no longer resist so she said to alghazban set me down for the pains of labour are upon me and cried to marjanah do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me then marjanah dismounted from her horse and alghazban did in like sort and they made fast the bridles and helped the princess to dismount for she was aswoon from excess of anguish when alghazban saw her on the ground satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face said o my lady vouchsafe me thy favours hearing these words she turned to him and said it remaineth for me only that i yield me to negro slaves after having refused kings and bravesand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the fiftysecond nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that princess abrizah said to the black slave al ghazban it remaineth for me only that i yield me to negro slaves after having refused kings and braves and she was wroth with him and cried woe to thee what words are these thou sayest out on thee and talk not thus in my presence and know that i will never consent to what thou sayest though i drink the cup of death wait till i have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth and then if thou be able thereto do with me as thou wilt but an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly i will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this and she began reciting extemporeo spare me thou ghazban indeed enow for me  are heavy strokes of time mischance and miserywhoredom my lord forfends to all humanity  quoth he 'who breaks my bidding hell for home shall see'and if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way  against th' almighty's choicest gift my chastityupon my tribesmen i with might and main will call  and gather all however far or near they beand with yamni blade were i in pieces hewn  ne'er shall he sight my face who makes for villeinythe face of free born come of noble folk and brave  what then can be to me the seed of whoreson slavewhen ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey his nostrils swelled his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled and he repeated these coupletsho thou abrizah mercy leave me not for i  of thy love and yamni glance the victim liemy heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty  my body wasted and my patience done to diefrom glances ravishing all hearts with witchery  reason far flies the while desire to thee draws nighthough at thy call should armies fill the face of earth  e'en now i'd win my wish and worlds in arms defywhen abrizah heard these words she wept with sore weeping and said to him woe to thee o ghazban how dareth the like of thee to address me such demand o base born and obscene bred dost thou deem all folk are alike when the vile slave heard this from her he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains such was the case with alghazban but as regards abrizah she gave birth to a son like the moon and marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side and lo and behold the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dying when marjanah saw this she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed saying alas my mistress alas the pity of it thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave after all thy knightly prowess and she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon but after awhile it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host now this was the army of king hardub princess abrizah's father and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to baghdad and that they were with king omar bin al nu'uman he had come forth leading those with him to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the king when he had gone a single day's march from his capital he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and marjanah and the slave al ghazban and he made for them to push inquiry seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself so he killed abrizah and fled for his life when they came up king hardub saw his daughter lying dead and marjanah weeping over her and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground all the riders of his company the emirs and waxirs took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the king a great pavilion domed and circular without which stood the grandees of the realm when marjanah saw her master she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled and when he came to himself he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to king omar bin alnu'uman and she informed him how sharrkan's father had dealt with the princess when king hardub heard this the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping then he called for a litter and therein laying his dead daughter returned to caesarea and carried her into the palace where he went in to his mother zat aldawahi and said to that lady of calamities shall the moslems deal thus with my girl verily king omar bin alnu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force and after this one of his black slaves slew her by the truth of the messiah i will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame else will i kill myself with mine own hand and he wept passing sore quoth his mother none other than marjanah killed thy daughter for she hated her in secret and she continued to her son fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter for by the truth of the messiah i will not turn back from king omar bin alnu'uman till i have slain him and his sons and of a very truth i will do with him a deed passing the power of sage and knight whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place but needs must thou do my bidding in all i shall direct for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire by the virtue of the messiah replied he i will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say then quoth she bring me a number of hand maids high bosomed virgins and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before kings and the art of conversation and making verses and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge and the sages must be moslems that they may teach them the language and traditions of the arabs together with the history of the caliphs and the ancient annals of the kings of alislam and if we persevere in this for four years' space we shall gain our case so possess thy soul in patience and wait for one of the arabs saith 'if we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye' when we have taught the girls these things we shall be able to work our will with our foe for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter she that hath found mercy as soon as i have made an end of their education as described to thee i will take them and set out with them in person when king hardub heard his mother's words he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him moslem sages they obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought when these came into presence he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels then he committed the handmaidens to their handsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the fiftythird nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of king hardub he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge philosophy and polite accomplishments and they set themselves to do his bidding such was the case with king hardub but as for king omar bin al nu'uman when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace he sought princess abrizah but found her not nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her this was grievous to him and he said how could the lady leave the palace unknown of any had my kingdom been at stake in this case it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it i will never again go to sport and hunt till i have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them and he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of princess abrizah hereupon behold his son sharrkan returned from his journey and the father told him what had happened and informed him how the lady had fled whilst he was chasing and hunting whereat he grieved with exceeding grief then king omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them appointing for them stipends when sharrkan saw this he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter so one day his father said to him why do i see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face o my father replied sharrkan every time i see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them jealousy seizeth on me and i fear lest it grow on me till i slay them and thou slay me in return and this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion but now i crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest that i may abide there the remnant of my life for as the sayer of bywords saith 'absence from my friend is better and fitter for me' and 'whatso eye doth not perceive that garreth not heart to grieve' and he bowed his head towards the ground when king omar bin alnu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down he soothed his heart and said to him o my son i grant thee this and i have not in my reign a greater than the castle of damascus and the government of it is thine from this time thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of damascus of syria and when they had written it he equipped him and sent with him the wazir dandan and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations and took leave of him and the grandees and officers of state did likewise and he set out with his host when he arrived at damascus the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank and the others to the left thus far concerning sharrkan but as regards his father omar bin al nu'uman soon after the departure of his son the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him o our lord thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony the king rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men seeing zau al makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship the prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers loving the poor the olema and the koran students so that all the people of baghdad loved him men and women one day the procession of the mahmil of irk passed round baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to meccah and visitation of the tomb of the prophet whom allah bless and preserve when zau almakan the mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim so he went in to his sire and said i come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage but his father forbade him saying wait till next year and i will go and thou too when the prince saw that the matter was postponed he betook himself to his sister nuzhat alzaman whom he found standing at prayer as soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her i am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the holy house of allah at meccah and to visit the tomb of the prophet upon whom be peace i asked my father's leave but he forbade me that so i mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge allah upon thee exclaimed she take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the prophet whom allah bless and keep and he answered as soon as it is dark night do thou come forth from this place without telling any accordinglywhen it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit and she ceased not walking to the palace gate where she found zau almakan with camels ready for marching so he mounted and mounted her and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the iraki pilgrimparty and they ceased not marching and allah wrote safety for them till they entered meccah the holy and stood upon araft and performed the pilgrimage rites then they made a visitation to the tomb of the prophet whom allah bless and assain and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land but zau almakan said to his sister o my sister it is in my mind to visit the holy house jerusalem and abraham the friend of allah on whom be peace i also desire so to do replied she so they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of jerusalem palmers that very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill and was grievously ill but presently recovered after which the brother also sickened she tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at jerusalem but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker they alighted at a khan and there hired a lodging but zau al makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious at this his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this is the decree of allah they sojourned in that place awhile his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left then she sent a servant of the khan to the bazar with some of her clothes and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had piece by piece till nothing was left but an old rug whereupon she wept and exclaimed verily is allah the orderer of the past and the future presently her brother said to her o my sister i feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat by allah o my brother replied she i have no face to beg but tomorrow i will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living then she bethought herself awhile and said of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state but i must despite myself he rejoined allah forbid thou wilt be put to shame but there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah and he wept and she wept too then she said o my brother we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year but none hath yet knocked at our door shall we then die of hunger i know no resource but that i go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive till thou recover from thy sickness when we will travel back to our native land she sat weeping awhile and he wept too propped upon his elbow then nuzhat alzaman arose and veiling her head with a bit of camlet which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him weeping and knowing not whither she should wend and she stinted not going and her brother zau almakan awaiting her return till the supper time but she came not and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not and this endured till two days went by he was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her and hunger was sore upon him at last he left the chamber and calling the servant of the caravanserai said i wish thee to bear me to the bazar so he carried him to the market street and laid him down there and the people of jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition he signed to them begging for somewhat to eat so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar and bought food and fed him therewith after which they carried him to a shop where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head when night fell all the folk went away sore concerned for him and in the middle of the night he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams and hiring a camel said to the driver carry this sick man to damascus and leave him in the hospital haply he may be cured and recover health on my head be it replied the camel man but he said to himself how shall i take this sick man to damascus and he nigh upon death so he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a hammam and went his way when morning dawned the stoker of the bath came to his work and finding zau almakan cast on his back exclaimed why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here so saying he gave him a kick and he moved whereupon quoth the fireman some one of you who hath eaten a bit of hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land and he cried there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah verily i have sinned against this youth for indeed the prophet whom allah bless and keep enjoineth honour to the stranger more especially when the stranger is sick then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him so she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face meanwhile the stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar and sprinkled zau almakan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him with this zau almakan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him and he sat up and leant against the pillow hereat the fireman rejoiced and exclaimed praise be to allah for the welfare of this youth o allah i beseech thee by thy knowledge of hidden things that thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my handsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the fiftyfourth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the fireman exclaimed o allah i beseech thee of thy knowledge of hidden things that thou make this young man's life the work of my hands and he ceased not to nurse him for three days giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water and doing him all manner of service and kindness till health began to return to his body and zau almakan opened his eyes presently came in the fireman and seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment said to him what is now thy state o my son praise be to allah replied zau almakan i am well and like to recover if such be the will of allah almighty at this time the stoker praised the lord of all for this and wending fast to the market bought ten chickens which he carried to his wife and said kill two of these for him every day one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day so she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth when he had done eating she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it after which she cut it up and bringing it to zau almakan said eat o my son while he was eating behold her husband entered and seeing her feeding him sat down at his head and said to him how is it with thee now o my son thanks be to allah for recovery he replied may the almighty requite thee thy kindness to me at this the fireman rejoiced and going out bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it now the stoker used to work at the hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams whereof he spent every day for zau almakan one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water and another dirham for fowls and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole thereupon the fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him o my son wilt thou go with me to the bath whereto he answered yes so the stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy and he mounted zau almakan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnaceroom and went forth to the market and bought iote leaves and lupinflour with which he returned to the bath and said to zau almakan o my master in allah's name walk in and i will wash thy body so they entered the inner room of the bath and the fireman took to rubbing zau almakan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal when there came to them a bathman whom the bath keeper had sent to zau almakan and he seeing the stoker washing and rubbing him said this is doing injury to the keeper's rights replied the fireman the master overwhelmeth us with his favours then the bathman proceeded to shave zau almakan's head after which he and the stoker washed themselves and returned to the house where he clad zau almakan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck meanwhile the fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens so as soon as zau almakan entered and seated himself on the carpet the husband arose and dissolving sugar in willow flower water made him drink of it then he brought the food tray and cutting up the chickens fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied when he washed his hands and praised allah for recovery and said to the fireman thou art he whom the almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure leave this talk replied the other and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me said zau almakan and after i will tell thee my story rejoined the fireman as for that i found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house as i went to my work near the morning and knew not who had thrown thee there so i carried thee home with me and this is all my tale quoth zau almakan glory to him who quickeneth the bones though they be rotten indeed o my brother thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage and he added but where am i now thou art in the city of jerusalem replied the stoker where upon zau almakan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept then he discovered his secret to the fireman and told him his story and began repeatingin love they bore me further than my force would go  and for them made me suffer resurrection throeoh have compassion cruel on this soul of mine  which since ye fared is pitied by each envious foenor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance  my case to lighten easing this excess of woequoth i 'heart bear this loss in patience' patience cried  'take heed no patience in such plight i'm wont to show' then he redoubled his weeping and the fireman said to him weep not but rather praise allah for safety and recovery asked zau almakan how far is it hence to damascus answered the other six days' journey then quoth zau almakan wilt thou send me thither o my lord quoth the stoker how can i allow thee to go alone and thou a youth and a stranger to boot if thou would journey to damascus i am one who will go with thee and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me i will take up my abode there for it is no light matter to part with thee then said he to his wife wilt thou travel with me to damascus of syria or wilt thou abide here whilst i lead this my lord thither and return to thee for he is bent upon going to damascus of syria and by allah it is hard to me to part with him and i fear for him from highway men replied she i will go with you both and he rejoined praised be allah for accord and we have said the last word then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gearand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the fiftyfifth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the fire man and his wife agreed with zau almakan to travel with him damascus wards then the stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for zau almakan and they set out and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached damascus and they arrived there towards eventide when the fireman went forth and as was his wont bought some meat and drink they had dwelt but five days in damascus when his wife sickened and after a short illness was translated to the mercy of almighty allah her death was a heavy matter to zau almakan for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously and the fireman grieved for her with excessive grief presently the prince turned to the stoker and finding him mourning said to him grieve not for at this gate we must all go in replied he allah make weal thy lot o my son surely he will compensate us with his favours and cause our mourning to cease what sayst thou o my son about our walking abroad to view damascus and cheer thy spirits replied zau almakan thy will is mine so the fireman arose and placed his hand in that of zau al makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the viceroy of damascus where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs and horses ready saddled and bactrian dromedaries while mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro quoth zau almakan i wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs so he asked one of the eunuchs whither this dispatching'' and he answered these are presents sent by the emir of damascus to king omar bin alnu'uman with the tribute of syria now when zau almakan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears and he began repeatingoh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne  ye whose sight in my spirit shall ever dwellyour charms are gone but this heart of me  hath no sweet and no pleasures its sour dispelif allah's grace make us meet again  in long drawn lovetale my love i'll telland when he had ended his verse he wept and the fireman said to him o my son we hardly believed that thy health had returned so take heart and do not weep for i fear a relapse for thee and he ceased not comforting and cheering him whilst zau almakan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these coupletsget thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way  and know how surely death descends thy life lot to waylayall thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine  all thy worldly life is vexing of thy soul in vain displaysay is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest  where at night he 'nakhs' his camels and moves off at dawn of dayand he continued to weep and wail over his separation whilst the fireman also bewept the loss of his wife yet ceased not to comfort zau almakan till morning dawned when the sun rose he said to him meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land yes replied zau almakan and i can no longer tarry here so i will commend thee to allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them little by little till i come to my mother land said the stoker and i with thee for of a truth i cannot bear to part with thee i have done thee kindly service and i mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel at this zau almakan rejoiced and said allah abundantly requite thee for me and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together the fireman at once went forth and bought another ass selling the camel and laid in his provaunt and said to zau almakan this is for thee to ride by the way and when thou art weary of riding thou canst dismount and walk said zau almakan may allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother then he waited till it was dark night when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey this much befel zau almakan and the fireman but as regards what happened to his sister nuzhat alzaman when she left her brother in the khan where they abode and wrapped in the old camlet went out to seek service with some one that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for she fared on weeping and knowing not whither to go whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land so she implored allah almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifyingdark falls the night and passion comes sore pains to gar me dree  and pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my tormentryand cease not separation flames my vitals to consume  and drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacyand longing breeds me restlessness desire for ever fires  and tears to all proclaim what i would keep in secrecyno cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure  that i may quit this sickly state may cure my maladythe love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel  the lover from its hell of fire must bear hell's agonyo thou who blamest me for all befel me 'tis enough  patient i bear what ever wrote the reed of doom for meby love i swear i'll never be consoled no never more  i swear the oath of love's own slaves who know no perjuryo night to chroniclers of love the news of me declare  that sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bearthen she walked on weeping and turning right and left as she went when behold there espied her an old badawi who had come into the town from the desert with wild arabs other five the old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet and marvelling at her beauty he said to himself this charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger i needs must have her so he followed her little by little till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane and called out to her asking her case and said tell me o my little daughter art thou a free woman or a slave when she heard this she said to him by thy life do not add to my sorrows quoth he allah hath blessed me with six daughters of whom five died and only one is left me the youngest of all and i came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger that i might take thee and carry thee to her to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters if thou have no kith and kin i will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children nuzhat alzaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself haply i may trust myself to this old man then she said to him o nuncle i am a maiden of the arabs and a stranger and i have a sick brother but i will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition which is that i may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother if thou strike this bargain i will fare with thee for i am a stranger and i was high in honour among my tribe and i awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject i came with my brother from the land of alhijaz and i fearless he know not where i am when the badawi heard this he said to himself by allah i have got my desire then he turned to her and replied there shall none be dearer to me than thou i wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall or if thou wilt bring him over to dwell with us and the badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him then he walked on before her and when she followed him he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels now this badawi was a base born churl a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief a rogue in grain past master of plots and chicane he had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when by the decree of the decreer he fell in with this unhappy one and he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of jerusalem and when outside he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries so the badawi mounted a camel having seated nuzhat alzaman behind him and they rode on all night then she knew that the badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long while they journeyed on making for the mountains in fear any should see them now when it was near dawn they dismounted from their dromedaries and the badawi came up to nuzhat alzaman and said to her o city strumpet what is this weeping by allah an thou hold not thy peace i will beat thee to death o thou town filth when she heard this she loathed life and longed for death so she turned to him and said o accursed old man o gray beard of hell how have i trusted thee and thou hast played me false and now thou wouldst torture me when he heard her reply he cried out o lazy baggage dost thou dare to bandy words with me and he stood up to her and beat her with a whip saying an thou hold not thy peace i will kill thee so she was silent awhile then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly next day she turned to the badawi and said to him how couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains and what is thy design with me when he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her o lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent wilt thou bandy words with me and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint then she bowed down over his feet and kissed them and he left beating her and began reviling her and said by the rights of my bonnet if i see or hear thee weeping i will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte o thou city filth so she was silent and made him no reply for the beating pained her but sat down with her arms round her knees and bowing her head upon her collar began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour and the beating she had endured and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition and how they were both strangers in a far country which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeatingtime hath for his wont to upraise and debase  nor is lasting condition for human racein this world each thing hath appointed turn  nor may man transgress his determined placehow long these perils and woes ah woe  for a life all woeful in parlous caseallah bless not the days which have laid me low  i' the world with disgrace after so much gracemy wish is baffled my hopes cast down  and distance forbids me to greet his faceo thou who passeth that dear one's door  say for me these tears shall flow evermorewhen she had finished her verses the badawi came up to her and taking compassion on her bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears then he gave her a barley scone and said i love not one who answereth at times when i am in wrath so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and i will sell thee to a good man like myself who will do well with thee even as i have done yes whatso thou doest is right answered she and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her she ate very little of that barley bread in the middle of the night the badawi gave orders for departureand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the fiftysixth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the badawi gave the barley scone to nuzhat alzaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself she replied whatso thou doest is right and about midnight when hunger burned her she ate a very little of that barley bread and the badawi ordered his party to set out so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting nuzhat alzaman behind him then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days till they entered the city of damascus and alighted at the sultan's khan hard by the viceroy's gate now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes so the badawi came up to her and said o thou city filth by the right of my bonnet if thou leave not this weeping i will sell thee to none but a jew then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber and walked off to the bazar and he went round to the merchants who dealt in slave girls and began to parley with them saying i have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill and i sent him to my people about jerusalem that they might tend him till he is cured as for her i want to sell her but after the dog her brother fell sick the separation from him was grievous to her and since then she doth nothing but weep and now i wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say 'thy brother is with me in jerusalem ill' and i will be easy with him about her price then one of the merchants came up to him and asked how old is she he answered she is a virgin just come to marriageable age and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness but from the day i sent her brother to jerusalem her heart hath been yearning for him so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened now when the merchant heard this he set forth with the badawi and said o shaykh of the arabs i will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness and i will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept i will give thee ready money and if thou accept not i will return her to thee quoth the badawi an thou wilt take her up to the sultan sharrkan son of omar bin alnu'uman lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan and condition me any conditions thou likest for when thou hast brought her before king sharrkan haply she will please him and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot rejoined the merchant it happens that i have just now something to ask from him and it is this that he write me an order upon the office exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father king omar bin alnu'uman so if he take the girl i will weigh thee out her price at once i agree with thee to this condition answered the badawi so they returned together to the place where nuzhat alzaman was and the wild arab stood at the chamber door and called out saying o njiyah which was the name wherewith he had named her when she heard him she wept and made no answer then he turned to the merchant and said to him there she sitteth go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as i enjoined thee so the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable especially as she knew the arabic tongue and he said to the badawi if she be even as thou saddest i shall get of the sultan what i will for her then he bespake her peace be on thee my little maid how art thou she turned to him and replied this also was registered in the book of destiny then she looked at him and seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face she said to herself i believe this one cometh to buy me and she continued if i hold aloof from him i shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating in any case this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a badawi may be he cometh only to hear me talk so i will give him a fair answer all this while her eyes were fixed on the ground then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice and upon thee be peace o my lord and allah's mercy and his benediction this is what is commanded of the prophet whom allah bless and preserve as for thine enquiry how i am if thou wouldst know my case it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe and she held her peace when the merchant heard what she said his fancy took wings for delight in her and turning to the badawi he asked him what is her price for indeed she is noble thereupon the badawi waxed angry and answered thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk why dost thou say that she is noble while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk i will not sell her to thee when the merchant heard this he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him calm thyself for i will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest and how much wilt thou give me for her enquired the badawi replied the merchant name thy price for her none should name the son save his sire rejoined the badawi none shall name it but thou thyself quoth the merchant to himself this wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head by allah i cannot tell her price for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks and if she can read and write it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser but this badawi does not know her worth then he turned and said to him o shaykh of the arabs i will give thee in ready money clear of the tax and the sultan's dues two hundred gold pieces now when the badawi heard this he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant saying get up and go thy ways by allah wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth i would not sell it to thee and now i will not sell her but will keep her by me to pasture the camels and grind my grist and he cried out to her saying come here thou stinkard i will not sell thee then he turned to the merchant and said to him i used to think thee a man of judgment but by the right of my bonnet if thou begone not from me i will let thee hear what shall not please thee quoth the merchant to himself of a truth this badawi is mad and knoweth not her value and i will say no more to him about her price at the present time for by allah were he a man of sense he would not say 'by the rights of my bonnet' by the almighty she is worth the kingdom of the chosros and i have not her price by me but if he ask even more i will give him what he will though it be all my goods then he turned and said to him o shaykh of the arabs take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee cried the badawi and what hath the baggage to do with clothes by allah this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her with thy leave said the merchant i will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying replied the other up and do what thou wilt and allah keep thy youth examine her outside and inside and if thou wilt strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked quoth the trader allah forfend i will look at naught save her face then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and lovelinessand shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the fiftyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the merchant went up to nuzhat alzaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness so he sat by her side and asked her o my mistress what is thy name she answered doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day thereupon the merchant enquired hast thou then two names to day's and yesterday's yes replied she my name in the past was nuzhat alzaman the delight of the age but my name at this present is ghussat alzaman the despight of the age when the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her hast thou not a sick brother ay by allah o my lord i have quoth she but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in jerusalem the merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself verily the badawi spake the truth of her then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him and she thought of all that had happened to her with the badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped and she began recitingallah where'er thou be his aid impart  to thee who distant dwellest in my heartallah be near thee how so far thou fare  ward off all shifts of time all dangers thwartmine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight  and start my tearsah me how fast they startwould heaven i kenned what quarter or what land  homes thee and in what house and tribe thou arta fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose  while drink i tear drops for my sole desertan thou 'joy slumber in those hours when i  peel 'twixt my side and couch coals' burning smartall things were easy save to part from thee  for my sad heart this grief is hard to dreewhen the merchant heard her verses he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks but she let down her veil over her face saying heaven forbid o my lord'' then the badawi who was sitting at a little distance watching them saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her so he rose and running to her dealt her with a camel's halter he had in his hand such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open and the blood streamed down her cheeks whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly the merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself there is no help for it but that i buy this damsel though at her weight in gold and free her from this tyrant and he began to revile the badawi whilst nazhat al zaman lay in sensible when she came to herself she wiped away the tears and blood from her face and she bound up her head then raising her glance to heaven she besought her lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeatingand pity one who erst in honour throve  and now is fallen into sore disgraceshe weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears  and asks 'what cure can meet this fatal case'when she had ended her verse she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone by the almighty do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not allah the most high if i pass this night in his place i shall kill myself with my own hand save me from him so allah save thee from gehennafire then quoth the merchant to the badawi o shaykh of the arabs this slave is none of thine affair so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt take her quoth the badawi and pay me down her price or i will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung said the merchant i will give thee fifty thousand diners for her allah will open replied the badawi seventy thousand said the merchant allah will open repeated the badawi this is not the capital spent upon her for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces the merchant rejoined thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley but i will say thee one word wherewith if thou be not satisfied i will set the viceroy of damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force the badawi continued say on an hundred thousand quoth the merchant i have sold her to thee at that price answered the badawi i shall be able to buy salt with her the merchant laughed and going to his lodgings brought the money and put it into the hand of the badawi who took it and made off saying to himself needs must i go to jerusalem where haply i shall happen on her brother and i will bring him here and sell him also so he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at jerusalem where he went to the khan and asked for zau almakan but could not find him such was the case with him but for what regards the merchant and nazhat alzaman when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgingsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the fiftyeighth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the trader saved nuzhat alzaman from the badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment he went down with her to the bazar where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag which he set before her saying all is for thee and i ask nothing of thee in return but that when i lead thee to the sultan viceroy of damascus thou acquaint him with the price i paid for thee albeit it was little compared with thy value and if seeing thee he buy thee of me thou tell him how i have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent and a written recommendation wherewith i can repair to his father king omar bin alnu'uman lord of baghdad to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which i traffic when she heard his words she wept and sobbed and the merchant said to her o my lady i observe that every time i mention baghdad thine eyes are tearful is there any one there whom thou lovest if it be a trader or the like tell me for i know all the merchants and so forth there and if thou wouldst send him a message i will bear it for thee replied she by allah i have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like i know none there but king omar bin nu'uman lord of baghdad when the merchant heard her words he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself by allah i have won my wish then he said to her hast thou been shown to him in time past she answered no but i was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and i have high honour with him so if thou wouldst have the king grant thee thy desire give me ink case and paper and i will write thee a letter and when thou reachest the city of baghdad do thou deliver it into the hand of king omar bin alnu'uman and say to him 'thy handmaid nuzhat alzaman would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place and she sendeth thee her salams' and if he ask further of her say that i am now with the viceroy at damascus the merchant wondered at her eloquence and his affection for her increased and he said to her i cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money tell me dost thou know the koran by heart yes answered she and i am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of galen the physician on the canons of hippocrates and i have commented him and i have read the tazkirah and have commented the burhn and i have studied the simples of ibn baytr and i have something to say of the canon of meccah by avicenna i can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy i have read the books of the shfi' school and the traditions of the prophet and syntax and i can argue with the olema and discourse of all manner learning moreover i am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs and i know thoroughly the spiritual sciences and the times appointed for religious duties and i understand all these branches of knowledge then quoth she to the merchant bring me ink case and paper that i write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to baghdad and enable thee to do without passports now when the merchant heard this he cried out brava brava then o happy he in whose palace thou shalt thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour she took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these versesi see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown  say did thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wonewhat makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart  hath every lover strength such memories to ownhow sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day  'tis gone and ere i taste its sweets afar 'tis flowni pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news  from thee to lover wightwi' love so woe begonecomplains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn  for parting pangs can break not only heart but stoneand when she had ended writing the verses she continued these words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight she tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes verily sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length no helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses'no ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light  but shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing mightno lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart  to meet his mate but breeds in me redoubled blighti bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me  ah me how love can part man's mortal frame and sprite' then her eyes welled over with tears and she wrote also these two coupletslove smote my frame so sore on parting day  that severance severed sleep and eyes for ayei waxt so lean that i am still a man  but for my speaking thou wouldst never saythen she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet this cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land the sorrowful hearted woman nuzhat alzaman in fine she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed glory to him who fashioned theeand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the fiftyninth nightshe said it reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat alzaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed glory to him who fashioned thee then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food wherewith he fed her after which he carried her to the hammam and said to the bath woman as soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head dress her and send and let me know of it and she replied hearing is obeying meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath and when the tire woman had done washing her she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench then she sent to tell the merchant and nuzhat alzaman went forth to the outer room where she found the tray spread with food and fruit so she ate and the tire woman with her and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath then she slept till the morning and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her when he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners a suit of turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems moreover he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein worth a thousand diners and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby and each ball a bezel of balass the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money when she had put these on the merchant bade her adorn herself and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her but when folk saw her all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed blessed be allah the most excellent creator o lucky the man in whose house the hall be and the trader ceased not walking and she behind him till they entered the palace of sultan sharrkan when he sought an audience and kissing the earth between his hands said o auspicious king i have brought thee a rare gift unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities quoth the king let me see it so the merchant went out and brought her she following him till he made her stand before king sharrkan when he beheld her blood yearned to blood though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called nuzhat al zaman and a brother zau almakan he having been jealous of them because of the succession and such was the cause of his knowing little about them then having placed her before the presence the merchant said o king of the age besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness she is also versed in all learning sacred and profane including the art of government and the abstract sciences quoth the king to the trader take her price according as thou boughtest her and go thy ways i hear and i obey replied the merchant but first write me a patent exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise said the king i will do this but first tell me what price thou paidest for her said the merchant i bought her for an hundred thousand diners and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand when the sultan heard these words he declared i will give thee a higher price than this for her and calling his treasurer said to him pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit thereupon the sultan summoned the four kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said i call you to witness that i free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her so the kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage when the sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse then after paying him his monies sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent exempting him from toll tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honourand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the sixtieth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate after paying him his monies and they wrote a perpetual patent exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour then all about him retired and none remained save the kazis and the merchant whereupon said he to the judges i wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader that we ascertain the truth of his assertions they answered there is no evil in that and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet when they learned that she was become the king's wife then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness presently the wives of the emirs and wazirs heard that king sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping and versed in all branches of knowledge that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four kazis to make trial of her how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them so they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was nuzhat al zaman when they came in to her they found the eunuchs standing before her and as soon as she saw the wives of the emirs and wazirs and grandees of the realm coming to call upon her she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy her handmaidens standing behind her and she received them saying ye be welcome the while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations as if she had been brought up with them so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another this damsel is none other than a queen the daughter of a king then they sat down magnifying her worth and said to her o our lady this our city is illumined by thee and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence the kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace and we all are thy handmaids so by allah do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty and she thanked them for this all this while the curtains were let down between nuzhat alzaman and the women with her on the one side and king sharrkan and the four kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other presently king sharrkan called to her and said o queen the glory of thine age this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge even to astrology so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects she replied saying o king to hear is to obey the first subjects whereof i will treat are the art of government and the duties of kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners know then o king that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life for none attaineth to religion save through this world because it is the best road to futurity now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people and men's doings are divided into four divisions government commerce husbandry and craftsmanship now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world which world is the road to futurity since allah almighty hath made the world for his servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to allah and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust if folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity all cause of contention would be cut off but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions so they have need of the sultan that he do justice between them and order their affairs and if the king restrain not his folk from one another the strong will drive the weak to the wall hence ardeshir saith 'religion and kingship be twins' religion is a hidden treasure and the king is its keeper and the divine ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule for know o king that according to the measure of the sultan's good morals even so will be the time as saith the apostle of allah on whom be peace and salvation 'there be two classes who if they be good the people will be good and if they be bad the people will be bad even the olema and the emirs' and it is said by a certain sage 'there be three kinds of kings the king of the faith the king who protecteth things to which reverence is due and the king of his own lusts' the king of the faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith and it behoveth he be the most faithful for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the faith and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to divine ordinance but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented because of submission to the decrees of destiny as for the king who protecteth things to be reverenced he upholdeth the things of the faith and of the world and compelleth his folk to follow the divine law and to preserve the rights of humanity and it fitteth him to unite pen and sword for whoso declineth from what pen hath written his feet slip and the king shall rectify his error with the sharp sword and dispread his justice over all mankind as for the king of his own lusts he hath no religion but the following his desire and as he feareth not the wrath of his lord who set him on the throne so his kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition and sages say 'the king hath need of many people but the people have need of but one king' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures that he reduce their discord to concord that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all and know o king that ardeshir styled jamr shadd or the live coal third of the kings of persia conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and for this purpose get for himself four seal rings one for each division the first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written alterna lives the second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies and on it was written building up the third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written plenty the fourth was the seal of the oppressed and on it was written justice and these usages remained valid in persia until the revelation of alislam chosros also wrote his son who was with the army 'be not thou too open handed with thy troops or they will be too rich to need thee'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the sixtyfirst nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that chosros wrote his son 'be not thou too open handed with thy troops or they will be too rich to need thee nor be thou niggardly with them or they will murmur against thee give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress' there is a legend that a desert arab came once to the caliph al mansr and said 'starve thy dog and he shall follow thee' when the caliph heard his words he was enraged with the arab but abu 'labbs of ts said to him 'i fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone the dog would follow him and leave thee alone' thereupon the caliph almansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present and know o king that abd almalik bin marwn wrote to his brother abd alazz when he despatched him to egypt as follows 'pay heed to thy secretaries and thy chamberlains for the secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the chamberlains with matters of official ceremony whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee' omar bin alkhattb whom allah accept when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts the second that he should not wear fine clothes the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period it is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence and there is no prudence like piety that there is no means of drawing near to god like good morals no measure like good breeding no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the divine favour that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law no science like that of meditation no worship like obeying the divine commends no faith like modesty no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge so guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth and think of death and doom ere it ariseth saith ali whose face allah honour 'beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them consult them not in aught but grudge not complaisance to them lest they greed for intrigue' and eke quoth he 'whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed' and there be rules for this which we will mention if it be allah's will and omar whom allah accept saith 'there are three kinds of women firstly the true believing heaven fearing love full and fruit full who helpeth her mate against fate not helping fate against her mate secondly she who loveth her children but no more and lastly she who is a shackle allah setteth on the neck of whom he will' men be also three the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement the wiser who when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight justice is indispensable in all things even slave girls have need of justice and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty their order would fall to pieces in short for the rest the prince of noble qualities is beneficence cum benevolence and how excellent is the saying of the poetby open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command  go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee'and quoth another'in ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect  and truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soulwhoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good word  on glory's course must ever be the first to gain the goal'and nazhat alzaman discoursed upon the policy of kings till the bystanders said never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this when she heard their words and understood them she said as for the chapter of good breeding it is wide of comprehension being a compend of things perfect now it so happened that one day there came to the caliph mu'wiyah one of his companions who mentioned the people of irak and the goodness of their wit and the caliph's wife maysn mother of yezd heard his words so when he was gone she said to the caliph 'o prince of the faithful i would thou let some of the people of irak come in and talk to thee that i may hear their discourse' therewith mu'awiyah said to his attendants 'see who is at the door' and they answered 'the banu tamim' 'let them come in' said he so they came in and with them alahnf son of kays then quoth mu'awiyah 'enter o abu bahr' and drew a curtain between himself and maysun that she might hear what they said without being seen herself then he said to alahnaf 'o son of the sea draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me' quoth alahnaf 'part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues and make the ghusl or complete ablution on friday as an expiation for all between the fridays'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the sixtysecond nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that ahnaf bin kays replied to almu'awiyah's question 'and ever use the toothstick because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two fridays' quoth mu'awiyah 'what is thy counsel to thyself' 'to set my feet firmly on the ground to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes' 'how dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe' 'i lower mine eyes modestly and i salute first i avoid what concerneth me not and i spare my words' 'and how when thou goest in to thine equals' 'i give ear to them when they speak and i do not assail them when they err' 'when thou goest in to thy chiefs' 'i salute without making any sign and await the reply if they bid me draw near i draw near and if they draw off from me i withdraw' 'how dost thou with thy wife' quoth ahnaf 'excuse me from answering this o commander of the faithful' but mu'awiyah cried 'i conjure thee inform me' he said 'i entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure for woman was created of a crooked rib' 'and how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her' 'i bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire then should it be as thou knowest i throw her on her back if the seed abide in her womb i say 'o allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel but fashion it into the best of fashions' then i rise from her to ablution and first i pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly i praise allah for the joy he hath given me' said mu'awiyah 'thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements' said ahnaf 'i would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of allah and do even handed justice between them' thereupon ahnaf rose to his feet and left the caliph's presence and when he had gone maysun said 'were there but this man in irak he would suffice to it' then continued nuzhat alzaman and all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding and know o king that muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the caliphate of omar bin alkhattband shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the sixtythird nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman continued know o king that mu'aykib was intendant of the public treasury during the caliphate of omar bin alkhattab and it so befel him that he saw omar's son and gave him a dirham out of the treasury thereupon quoth mu'aykib 'i returned to my own house and while i was sitting there behold a messenger came to me from omar and i was afraid and went to him and when i came into his presence in his hand was the dirham i had given his son he said to me 'woe to thee mu'aykib i have found somewhat concerning thy soul' i asked 'and what is that' and he answered 'it is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to the followers of mohammed on whom be peace and salvation in the matter of this dirham and thou wilt have to account for it on resurrection day' and omar also wrote a letter to ab ms alashri as follows 'when these presents reach thee give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest' and he did so now when othman succeeded to the caliphate he wrote a like letter to abu musa who did his bidding and sent him the tribute accordingly and with it came ziyd and when ziyad laid the tribute before othman the caliph's son came in and took a dirham whereupon ziyad shed tears othman asked 'why weepest thou' and ziyad answered 'i once brought omar bin alkhattab the like of this and his son took a dirham where upon omar bade snatch it from his hand now thy son hath taken of the tribute yet i have seen none say aught to him or snatch the money from him' then othman cried 'and where wilt thou find the like of omar' again zayd bin aslam relates of his father that he said 'i went out one night with omar till we approached a blazing fire quoth omar 'o aslam i think these must be travellers who are suffering from the cold come let us join them' so we walked on till we came to them and behold we found a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by her side were two children both a wailing said omar 'peace be with you o folk of light for it was repugnant to him to say 'folk of fire' what aileth you' said she 'the cold and the night trouble us' he asked 'what aileth these little people that they weep' and she answered 'they are hungry' he enquired 'and what is in this cauldron' and she replied 'it is what i quiet them withal and allah will question omar bin al khattab of them on the day of doom' he said 'and what should omar know of their case' 'why then' rejoined she 'should he manage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them' thereupon omar turned to me continned aslam and cried 'come with us' so we set off running till we reached the pay department of his treasury where he took out a sack containing flour and a pot holding fat and said to me 'load these on my back' quoth i 'o commander of the faithful i will carry them for thee' he rejoined 'wilt thou bear my load for me on the day of resurrection' so i put the things on his back and we set off running till we threw down the sack hard by her then he took out some of the flour and put it in the cauldron and saying to the woman 'leave it to me' he began blowing the fire under the cauldron now he was a long bearded man and i saw the smoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flour was cooked when he took some of the fat and threw it in and said to the woman 'bed them while i cool it for them' so they fell to eating till they had eaten their fill and he left the rest with her then he turned to me and said 'o aslam i see it was indeed hunger made them weep and i am glad i did not go away ere i found out the cause of the light i saw'and shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the sixtyfourth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman continued it is related that omar passed by a flock of sheep kept by a mameluke and asked him to sell him a sheep he answered 'they are not mine' 'thou art the man i sought' said omar and bought him and freed him whereupon the slave exclaimed 'o allah as thou hast bestowed on me the lesser emancipation so vouchsafe me the greater' it is also said that omar bin al khattab was wont to give his servants sweet milk and himself eat coarse fare and to clothe them softly and himself wear rough garments he rendered unto all men their due and exceeded in his giving to them he once gave a man four thousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand wherefore it was said to him 'why dost thou not increase to thy son as thou increasest to this man' he answered 'this man's father stood firm at the battle day of ohod' alhasan relates that omar once came back from foray with much money and that hafsah approached him and said 'o commander of the faithful the due of kinship' 'o hafsah' replied he 'verily allah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship but not with the monies of the true believers indeed thou pleasest thy family but thou angerest thy father' and she went away trailing her skirts the son of omar said 'i implored the lord to show me my father one year after his death till at last i saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him 'how is it with thee o my father' he answered 'but for my lord's mercy thy father surely had perished' then said nuzhat alzaman hear o auspicious king the second division of the first chapter of the instances of the followers of the apostle and other holy men saith al hasan albasr not a soul of the sons of adam goeth forth of the world without regretting three things failure to enjoy what he hath amassed failure to compass what he hoped failure to provide himself with sufficient viaticum for that hereto he goeth it was said of sufyan 'can a man be a religious and yet possess wealth' he replied 'yes so he be patient when grieved and be thankful when he hath received' abdullah bin shaddd being about to die sent for his son mohammed and admonished him saying 'o my son i see the summoner of death summoning me and so i charge thee to fear allah both in public and private to praise allah and to be soothfastin thy speech for such praise bringeth increase of prosperity and piety in itself is the best of provision for the next world even as saith one of the poets'i see not happiness lies in gathering gold  the man most piousis man happiestin truth the fear of god is best of stores  and god shall makethe pious choicely blest'then quoth nuzhat alzaman let the king also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter he asked her 'what be they' and she answered when omar bin abd alazz succeeded to the caliphate he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold put it into the public treasury so the banu umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister ftimah daughter of marwan and she sent to him saying 'i must needs speak to thee' so she came to him by night and when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down he said to her 'o aunt it is for thee to speak first since thou hast some thing to ask tell me then what thou wouldst with me' replied she 'o commander of the faithful it is thine to speak first for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others' then said omar 'of a verity allah almighty sent mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others and he elected for him those with him and commissioned him as his apostle and took him to himself'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the sixtyfifth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman continued thus said omar 'verily allah commissioned as his apostle mohammed upon whom be the benediction of allah and his salvation for a blessing to some and a bane to others and he elected for him those with him and took him to himself leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink after him abu bakr the truth teller became caliph and he left the river as it was doing what was pleasing to allah then arose omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like but when othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream and mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets and without ceasing in like manner yezid and the banu marwn such as abd almalik and wald and sulaymn drew away water from the stream and the main course dried up till rule devolved upon me and now i am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition' when fatimah heard this she said 'i came wishing only to speak and confer with thee but if this be thy word i have nothing to say to thee' then she returned to the ommiades and said to them 'now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with omar bin alkhattab' and it is also said that when omar was about to die he gathered his children round him and maslamah bin abd almalik said to him 'o prince of the faithful how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector none can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee' omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied 'o maslamah i have defended them from this sin all the days of my life and shall i make them miserable after my death of a truth my sons are like other men either obedient to almighty allah who will prosper them or disobedient and i will not help them in their disobedience know o maslamah that i was present even as thou when such an one of the sons of marwanwas buried and i fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of allah to whom belong honour and glory this terrified me and made me tremble and i vowed to allah that if ever i came to power i would not do such deeds as the dead man had done i have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and i hope to die in the mercy of my lord' quoth maslamah 'a certain man died and i was present at his burial and when all was over i fell asleep and i saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes he came up to me and said 'o maslamah it is for the like of this that rulers should rule' many are the instances of this kind and quoth one of the men of authority 'i used to milk the ewes in the caliphate of omar bin abd alaziz and one day i met a shepherd among whose sheep i saw a wolf or wolves i thought them to be dogs for i had never before seen wolves so i asked 'what dost thou with these dogs' 'they are not dogs but wolves' answered the shepherd quoth i 'can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them' quoth he 'when the head is whole the body is whole' omar bin abd alaziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and after praising and glorifying allah almighty said three words as follows 'o folk make clean your inmost hearts that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren and abstain ye from the things of the world know that between us and adam there is no one man alive among the dead dead are abd al malik and those who forewent him and omar also shall die and those who forewent him' asked maslamah 'o commander of the faithful an we set a pillow behind thee wilt thou lean on it a little while' but omar answered 'i fear lest it be a fault about my neck on resurrection day' then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint whereupon fatimah cried out saying 'ho maryam ho muzahim ho such an one look to this man' and she began to pour water on him weeping till he revived from his swoon and seeing her in tears said to her 'what causeth thee to weep o fatimah' she replied 'o commander of the faithful i saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before almighty allah of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us this is what made me weep' answered he 'enough o fatimah for indeed thou exceedest' then he would have risen but fell down and fatimah strained him to her and said 'thou art to me as my father and my mother o commander of the faithful we cannot speak to thee all of us' then quoth nuzhat alzaman to her brother sharrkan and the four kazis here endeth the second section of the first chapterand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the sixtysixth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman said to her brother sharrkan and the four kazis here endeth the second section of the first chapter and it so happened that omar bin abd alaziz wrote to the people of the festival at meccah as follows 'i call allah to witness in the holy month in the holy city and on the day of the greater pilgrimage that i am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you in that i have neither commanded this nor purposed it neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me nor have i compassed any knowledge thereof and i trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man for i shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress and if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the holy book and the traditions of the apostle do authorise obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness' he said also allah accept of him 'i do not wish to be relieved from death because it is the supreme thing for which the true believer is rewarded' quoth one of authority 'i went to the prince of the faithful omarbin abd alaziz who was then caliph and saw before him twelve dirhams which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury so i said to him 'o commander of the faithful thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live an thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house it were well' 'draw near to me' answered he so i drew near to him and he said 'now as for thy saying 'thou beggarest thy children provide for them and for the poor of thy household' it is without reason for allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house and he will be their guardian verily they are like other men he who feareth allah right soon will allah provide for him a happy issue and he that is addicted to sins i will not up hold him in his sin against allah' then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them 'your father is between two things either ye will be well to do and your parent will enter the fire or ye will be poor and your parent will enter paradise and your father's entry into paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do so arise and go allah be your helper for to him i commit your affairs' khlid bin safwn said 'ysuf bin omar accompanied me to hishm bin abd almalik and as i met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants he alighted and a tent was pitched for him when the people had taken their seats i came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him and waiting till my eyes met his eyes bespoke him thus 'may allah fulfil his bounty to thee o commander of the faithful i have an admonition for thee which hath come down to us from the history of the kings preceding thee' at this he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me 'bring what thou hast o son of safwan' quoth i 'o commander of the faithful one of the kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time to this very country and said to his companions 'saw ye ever any state like mine and say me hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me' now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to truth upholders of the right and wayfarers in its highway and he said to him 'o king thou askest of a grave matter wilt thou give me leave to answer' 'yes' replied the king and the other said 'dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting' 'it is temporary' replied the king 'how then' rejoined the man 'do i see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned' quoth the king 'whither shall i flee and what must i seek for me' 'that thou abide in thy kingship' replied the other 'or else robe thee in rags and apply thyself to obey almighty allah thy lord until thine appointed hour i will come to thee again at daybreak' khalid bin safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold the king had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite for the stress of his exhortation when hishm bin abd almalik heard this he wept till his beard was wet and bidding his rich apparel be put off shut himself up in his palace then the grandees and dependents came to khalid and said 'what is this thou hast done with the commander of the faithful thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life' then quoth nuzhat alzaman addressing herself to sharrkan how many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter of a truth i cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sittingand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the sixtyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman continued speaking to sharrkan know o king that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth i cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but with length of days o king of the age all will be well there said the kazis o king of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world and of our age the unique pearl never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives and they called down blessings on the king and went away then sharrkan turned to his attendants and said begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds so they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands and he commanded the wives of the emirs and wazirs and grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls and the subjects ate till they were satisfied moreover sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of damascus and they were present together with every slave girl of the king and of the notables who knew how to sing and they went up to the palace in one body when the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles right and left from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace and the emirs and wazirs and grandees marched past before king sharrkan whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her but found she needed no adornment meantime king sharrkan went to the hammam and coming out sat down on his seat of estate whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights then sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead and she at once conceived by him and when she announced it he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception on the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father king omar bin alnu'uman saying that he had bought him a damsel who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge moreover he wrote there is no help but that i send her to baghdad to visit my brother zau almakan and my sister nuzhat alzaman i have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me and he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the wazir dandan and all the emirs then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence sharrkan took it and read as follows after the usual bismillah this is from the afflicted distracted man from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban king omar bin al nu'uman to his son sharrkan know that since thy departure from me the place is become contracted upon me so that no longer i have power of patience nor can i keep my secret and the cause thereof is as follows it chanced that when i went forth to hunt and course zau almakan sought my leave to fare hijaz wards but i fearing for him the shifts of fortune forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after my absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole monthand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the sixtyeighth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king omar bin alnu'uman wrote in his letter my absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month and when i returned i found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth when i knew this the wide world narrowed on me o my son but i awaited the return of the caravan hoping that haply they would come back with it accordingly when the palmers appeared i asked concerning the twain but they could give me no news of them so i donned mourning for them being heavy at heart and in sleep i have no part and i am drowned in the tears of my eyes then he wrote in versethat pair in image quits me not one single hour  whom in my heart's most honourable place i keepsans hope of their return i would not live one hour  without my dreams of them i ne'er would stretch me in sleepthe letter went on and after the usual salutations to thee and thine i command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us when sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister then he took the missive and went in with it to nuzhat alzaman who knew not that he was her brother nor he that she was his sister albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter whereupon she sent for sharrkan and seeing him she said to him this is thy daughter name her as thou wilt quoth he it is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw hung about its neck a jewel which he knew at once for one of those which princess abrizah had brought from the land of the greeks now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well his senses fled and wrath seized on him his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at nuzhat al zaman and said to her whence hadst thou this jewel o slave girl when she heard this from sharrkan she replied i am thy lady and the lady of all in thy palace art thou not ashamed to say to me slave girl i am a queen daughter of king omar bin alnu'uman hearing this he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwardsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the sixtyninth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sharrkan heard these words his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards for he knew that she was his sister by the same father then he lost his senses and when he revived he abode in amazement but did not discover his identity to her and asked o my lady say art thou in sooth the daughter of king omar bin al nu'uman yes answered she and he continued tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave so she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end how she had left her brother sick in the sanctified city jerusalem and how the badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader when sharrkan heard this he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself how can i have my sister to wife by allah needs must i marry her to one of my chamberlains and if the thing get wind i will declare that i divorced her before consummation and married her to my chief chamberlain then he raised his head and sighing said o nuzhat alzaman thou art my very sister and i cry 'i take refuge with allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen' for i am sharrkan son of omar bin alnu'uman she looked at him and knew he spoke the truth and becoming as one demented she wept and buffeted her face exclaiming there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah verily have we fallen into mortal sin what shall i do and what shall i say to my father and my mother when they ask me whence hadst thou thy daughter quoth sharrkan it were meetest that i marry thee to my chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house that none may know thou be my sister this hath befallen us from almighty allah for a purpose of his own and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this chamberlain ere any know then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him what wilt thou call the girl call her kuzia fakn answered he then he gave the mother in marriage to the chief chamberlain and transferred her to his house with the child which they reared on the laps of the slave girls and fed with milk and dosed with powders now all this occurred whilst the brother zau almakan still tarried with the fireman at damascus one day there came to king sharrkan a courier from his father with a letter which he took and read and found therein after the bismillah know o beloved king that i am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me i send thee this letter that as soon as thou receivest it thou make ready the monies and the tribute and send them to us together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife for i long to see her and hear her discourse more especially because there hath come to us from roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments as soon as i saw them i loved them and i wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand for none of the kings owneth the like of them so i asked the old woman their price and she answered 'i will not sell them but for the tribute of damascus' and i by allah did not hold this price exorbitant indeed it is but little for each one of them is worth the whole valuation so i agreed to that and took them into my palace and they remain in my possession wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and if she prevail over them i will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of baghdadand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seventieth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king omar son of alnu'uman said in his letter and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and if she prevail over them i will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of baghdad as soon as sharrkan knew the contents he went in to his brother in law and said to him bring the damsel to whom i married thee and when she came he showed her the letter and said o my sister what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter replied she seek advice from thyself and presently added for she yearned after her people and her native land send me together with my husband the chamberlain to baghdad that i may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the badawi who sold me to the merchant and that i also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the chamberlain after setting me free be it so replied sharrkan then sharrkan took his daughter kuzia fakan and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs and he made ready the tribute in haste bidding the chamberlain travel with the princess and the treasure to baghdad he also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife and the chamberlain replied to hear is to obey moreover sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the chamberlain then he bade farewell to his sister after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold and she and her husband set out for baghdad the same night now it so happened that zau almakan and his friend the fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were to see the spectacle and they beheld camels and bukhti dromedaries and btmules and torches and lanterns alight and zau almakan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of damascus going to king omar bin alnu'uman lord of the city of baghdad he then asked who be the leader of the caravan and they answered the head chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science thereupon zau almakan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land and he said to the stoker i will join this caravan and little by little will journey homewards quoth the fireman i would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the holy city to damascus then how shall i be sure of thy safety when thou farest for baghdad but i will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object with joy and good will answered zau almakan then the fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt and when all was prepared he awaited the passage of the caravan and presently the chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him then zau alma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion do thou mount with me but he replied not so i will be thy servant quoth zau almakan there is no help for it but thou ride awhile 'tis well quoth the stoker i will ride when i grow tired then said zau almakan o my brother soon shalt thou see how i will deal with thee when i come to my own folk so they fared on till the sun rose andwhen it was the hour of the noonday sleep the chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels then he gave the signal for departure and after five days they came to the city of hamh where they set down and made a three days' haltand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seventyfirst nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that they halted in the city of hamah three days they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province diyr bakr here blew on them the breezes of baghdad and zau almakan bethought him of his father and mother and native land and how he was returning to his sire without his sister so he wept and sighed and complained and his regrets grew on him and he began improvising these coupletssweetheart how long must i await by so long suffering teed  nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abideah me in very sooth our meeting time was short enow  would heaven shorter prove to me the present partingtidenow trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight  how wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste i hidewhen say they 'comfort take for loss of love' i but reply  'by allah till the day of doom no comfort shall betide' thereupon said to him the fireman leave this weeping and wailing for we are near the chamberlain's tent quoth zau al makan needs must i recite somewhat of verse haply it may quench the fire of my heart allah upon thee cried the other cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country then do what thou wilt and i will be with thee wherever thou art replied zau almakan by allah i cannot forbear from this then he turned his face towards baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place and nuzhat alzaman could not sleep that night but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept and while she was in tears he heard zau almakan weeping and improvising the following distichs'alyaman's levengleam i see  and sore despair despaireth mefor friend who erst abode wi' me  crowning my cup with gladdest greeit minds me o' one who jilted me  to mourn my bitter libertysay sooth thou fair sheet lightning shall  we meet once more in joy and gleeo blamer spare to me thy blame  my lord hath sent this dule to dreeof friend who left me fain to flee  of time that breeds

fright and miserythat wastes his days in lonely grief  for 'time's delight' no more must bedoomed us despite our will to bear  the hands of base bores cark and carewhen he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit this is how it fared with him but as regards nuzhat al zaman when she heard that voice in the night her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the chief eunuch who said to her what is thy will quoth she arise and bring me him who recited verses but now replied he of a truth i did not hear himand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seventysecond nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when nuzhat alzaman heard her brother reciting she called the chief eunuch and said to him go fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping but she said whomsoever thou seest awake he is the reciter so he went yet found none on wake save the stoker for zau almakan was still insensible and when his companion saw the eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him the stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter and being afraid he replied by allah 'twas not i rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me thou must know who it was seeing that thou art awake the fireman feared for zau al makan and said in himself haply the eunuch will do him some hurt so he answered by allah i know not who it was said the eunuch by allah thou liest for there is none on wake here but thou so needs must thou know him by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth some passer by some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake allah requite him quoth the eunuch if thou happen upon him point him out to me and i will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady's litter or do thou take him with thine own hand said the fireman go thou back and i will bring him to thee so the eunuch left him and went his ways and going in to his mistress told her all this and said to her none knoweth who it was it must have been some passer by some wayfarer and she was silent meanwhile zau almakan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle heavens the breath of the dawn breeze breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses when the fire man asked him what wilt thou do answered zau almakan i have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry that i may quench therewith the fire of my heart quoth the other thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint and how i escaped death only by beguiling the eunuch tell me what happened quoth zau almakan replied the stoker whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an eunuch with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand who took to looking in all the people's faces as they lay asleep and asked me who it was recited the verses finding none awake but myself i told him in reply it was some passerby some wayfarer so he went away and allah delivered me from him else had he killed me but first he said to me 'if thou hear him again bring him to us' when zau almakan heard this he wept and said who is it would forbid me to recite i will surely recite befal me what may for i am near mine own land and care for none rejoined the fireman thy design is naught save to lose thy life and zau almakan retorted needs must i recite verses verily said the stoker needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place albeiti had intended not to leave thee till i had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and i have never harmed thee in aught what ails thee then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue but zau almakan answered i will not be turned away from my purpose then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these coupletsstand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead  cry thou for an answer belike reply to thee shall be spedif the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch  wi' repine and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greedif the snake of the sand dunes hiss i shall marvel not at all  let him bite so i bite those beauteous lips of the luscious redo eden my soul hath fled in despite of the maid i love  had i lost hope of heaven my heart in despair were deadand he also improvised the two following distichswe were and were the days enthralled to all our wills  dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest sitewho shall restore the home of the beloved where showed  light of the place for aye conjoined with time's delight''and as he ceased his verses he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the fireman rose and covered him when nuzhat alzaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home then she wept and cried at the eunuch and said to him woe to thee he who recited the first time hath recited a second time and i heard him hard by by allah an thou fetch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee out but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt if he refuse hand to him this purse of a thousand diners then leave him and return to me and tell me after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is return quickly and linger notand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seventythird nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman sent the eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said beware how thou come back to me and report i could not find him so the eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents but found none awake all being asleep for weariness till he came to the stoker and saw him sitting up with his head uncovered so he drew near and seizing him by the hand said to him it was thou didst recite the verses the fireman was afeard for his life and replied no by allah o chief of the people it was not i but the eunuch said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zau almakan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and i know him not i only heard some passer by some wayfarer recite verses so do not thou commit sin on me for i am a stranger and come from the holy city of jerusalem and abraham the friend of allah be with you all rise up and fare with me rejoined the eunuch and tell my lady this with thine own mouth for i have seen none awake save thyself quoth the stoker hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where i now am and dost thou not know my station thou wottest none can stir from his place except the watchman seize him so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or some one i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me then he kissed the eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away but the castrato fetched a round and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings as soon as he was gone the stoker arose and aroused zau almakan and said to him come sit up that i may tell thee what hath happened so zau almakan sat up and his companion told him what had passed and he answered let me alone i will take no heed of this and i care for none for i am mine own country quoth the stoker why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil if thou fear no one i fear for thee and for my life so allah upon thee recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land indeed i had not deemed thee so ill conditioned dost thou not know that this lady is the wife of the chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her belike she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home and this is the second time she hath sent the eunuch to look for thee however zau almakan paid no heed to the fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these coupletsi fly the carper's injury whose carping sorely vexeth mehe chides and taunts me wotting not  he burns me but more grievouslythe blamer cries 'he is consoled'  i say 'my own dear land to see'they ask 'why be that land so dear'  i say 'it

love would deal me shamehardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion when the eunuch who had heard him from his hiding place at his head came up to him whereupon the fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them then said the eunuch to zau almakan peace be with thee o my lord and on thee be peace replied zau almakan and the mercy of allah and his blessings o my lord continued the eunuchand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seventyfourth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the eunuch said to zau almakan o my lord i have sought thee these several times this night for my mistress biddeth thee to her quoth zau al makan and who be this bitch that seeketh for me allah curse her and curse her husband with her and he began to revile the eunuch who could make him no answer because his mistress had charged him to do zau almakan no hurt nor bring him save of his own especial free will and if he would not accompany him to give him the thousand diners so the castrato began to speak him fair and say to him o my lord take this purse and go with me we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and return in weal and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news when zau al makan heard this he arose and went with the eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk stepping over them whilst the fireman followed after them from afar and kept his eye upon him and said to himself alas the pity of his youth tomorrow they will hang him and he ceased not following them till he approached their station without any observing him then he stood still and said how base it will be of him if he say it was i who bade him recite the verses this was the case of the stoker but as regards what befel zau almakan he ceased not walking with the eunuch till he reached his station and the castrato went in to nuzhat alzaman and said o my lady i have brought thee him whom thou soughtest and he is a youth fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding when she heard this her heart fluttered and she cried let him recite some verses that i may hear him near hand and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land then the eunuch went out to zau almakan and said to him recite what verses thou knowest for my lady is here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition replied he with love and gladness but an thou ask my name it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste i have a story the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown and behold i am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought when nuzhat alzaman heard this she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing and said to the eunuch ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father the castrato asked as she bade him and zau almakan replied yes i have parted from every one i loved but the dearest of all to me was my sister from whom fate hath separated me when nuzhat al zaman heard this she exclaimed allah almighty reunite him with what he lovethand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seventyfifth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when nuzhat alzaman heard his words she said allah reunite him with what he loveth then quoth she to the eunuch tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country the eunuch did so and zau almakan sighed heavily and began repeating these coupletsis not her love a pledge by all mankind confest  the house that hometh hinda be forever blest'her love all levels man can reck of naught beside  naught or before or after can for man have zest'tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris  that day

maidens soft and whiteto sound of harps in various modes they smite  draining the bowl while eyes rain lively light'neath half closed lids a sipping lips red bright  by stream bank flowing through my garden sitewhen he had finished his verse nuzhat alzaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him as soon as her eyes fell on his face she knew him for certain and cried out o my brother o zau almakan he also looked at her and knew her and cried out o my sister o nuzhat alzaman then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit when the eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover after a while they came to themselves and nuzhat alzaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these versestime sware my life should fare in woeful waste  forsworn art time expiate thy sin in hastecomes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid  to him who brings good news rise gird thy waisti spurned old world tales of eden bliss  till came i kausar on those lipswhen zau almakan heard this he pressed his sister to his breast tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these coupletslong i lamented that we fell apart  while tears repentant railed from these eyneand sware if time unite us twain once more  'severance' shall never sound from tongue of minejoy hath so overwhelmed me that excess  of pleasure from mine eyes draws gouts of brinetears o mine eyes have now become your wont  ye weep for pleasure and you weep for pinethey sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee and i will tell thee what happened to me so they entered and zau almaken said do thou begin thy tale accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the khan and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother sharrkan and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of buying how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharrkan then quoth she praised be allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that even as we left our father together so together shall we return to him and she added of a truth my brother sharrkan gave me in marriage to this chamberlain that he might carry me to my father and this is what befel me from first to last so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since i left thee thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end and how allah vouchsafed to send the fireman to him and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day she praised the stoker for this and zau almakan added of a truth o my sister this fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son for that he fasted and gave me to eat and he walked whilst he made me ride and i owe my life to him said she allah willing we will requite him for all this according to our power then she called the eunuch who came and kissed zau al makan's hand and she said take thy reward for glad tidings o face of good omen it was thy hand reunited me with my brother so the purse i gave thee and all in it are thine but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me the castrato rejoiced and going in to the chamberlain him to his mistress accordingly he came in to his wife and finding zau almakan with her asked who he was so she told him all that had befallen them both first and last and added know o chamberlain that thou hast married no slave girl far from it thou hast taken to wife the daughter of king omar bin alnu'uman for i am nuzhat al zaman and this is my brother zau almakan when the chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become king omar bin alnu'uman's son in law so he said to himself  'twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province then he went up to zau almakan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride thereupon said nuzhat alzaman we are now near our country and i would be left alone with my brother that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach baghdad for we have been parted a long long time be it as thou biddest replied the chamberlain and going forth from them sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats together with three suits of the costliest for zau almakan then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and nuzhat alzaman said to him bid the eunuch bring me the fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening and let him be forbidden to leave us the chamberlain called the castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girthing his ass and preparing for flight the tears were running adown his cheeks out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from zau almakan and he was saying to himself indeed i warned him for the love of allah but he would not listen to me oh would i knew what is become of him ere he had done speaking the eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him the fireman turned and seeing the eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fearand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seventysixth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him ere he had done speaking the castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices i have done him i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages et about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime then the effeminated one cried at him saying who was it recited the verses o liar why didst thou say 'i never repeated these couplets nor do i know who repeated them' when it was thy companion but now i will not leave thee between this place and baghdad and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee quoth the fireman what i feared hath befallen me and he repeated this couplet'twas as i feared the coming ills discerning  but unto allah we are all returningthen the eunuch cried upon the pages saying take him off the ass so they carried him along with the caravan surrounded by the pages as the white contains the black of the eye and the castrato said to them if a hair of him be lost you will be lost with it and he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him but when the stoker saw himself beset by the pages he despaired of his life and turning to the eunuch said to him o chief i am neither this youth's brother nor am i akin to him nor is he sib to me but i was a fireman in a hammam and found him cast out in his sickness on the dung heap then the caravan fared on and the stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things whilst the eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing but said to him thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses thou and this youth but fear nothing for thy self and kept laughing at him the while to himself whenever the caravan halted they served him with food and he and the castrato ate from one dish then the eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and after drinking himself gave it to the fireman who drank but all the while his tears never dried out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from zau almakan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood so they both travelled on with the caravan whilst the chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter in attendance on zau almakan and his sister and now gave an eye to the fireman and nuzhat alzaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from baghdad here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts behold there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night thereupon the chamberlain cried out to them stay and your loading delay then mounting with his mamelukes rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud when they drew near suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea with flags and standards drums and kettledrums horsemen and footmen the chamberlain marvelled at this and when the troops saw him there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them five for one whereupon said he to them what is the matter and what are these troops that ye do this with us asked they who art thou and whence comest thou and whither art thou bound and he answered i am the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharrkan son of omar bin alnu'uman lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan and i bring tribute and presents from him to his father in baghdad when the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept saying in very sooth king omar is dead and he died not but of poison so fare ye forwards no harm shall befal you till you join his grand wazir dandan now when the chamberlain heard this he wept sore and exclaimed oh for our disappointment in this our journey then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the wazir dandan who granted an interview and called a halt and causing his pavilion to be pitched sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the chamberlain then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamberlain to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribute of syria the wazir hearing the mention of king omar's name wept and said king omar is dead by poison and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him until they were like to slay one another on this account but the notables and grandees and the four kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharrkan and make him sultan over his father's realm and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zau almakan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nuzhat alzaman highs the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for alhijaz and none wotteth what is become of them when the chamberlain heard this he knew that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures and he grieved with sore grief for the death of king omar albeit he joyed with exceeding joy especially at the arrival of zau almakan for that he would now become sultan of baghdad in his father's steadand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seventyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sharrkan's chamberlain heard of the death of king omar bin al nu'uman he mourned but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother zau almakan who would become sultan of baghdad in his father's stead so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him verily your tale is a wonder of wonders know o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for that his almighty will restoreth to you zau almakan and his sister nuzhat alzaman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence so he repeated to him the whole story and told him that nuzhat alzaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of zau almakan from first to last as soon as he had ended his tale the wazir sent for the emirs and wazirs and chief officers and acquainted them with the matter whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance then they gathered in a body and went in to the chamberlain and did their service to him kissing the ground between his hands and the wazir dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour after this the chamberlain held on that day a divan council and he and the wazir sat upon a throne whilst all the emirs and grandees and officers of state took their places before them according to their several ranks then they melted sugar in rose water and drank after which the emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them so the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting rode onwards preceded by the standards of war when the grandees had finished their conference they took horse and rejoined the host and the chamberlain approached the wazir dandan and said i deem it well to ride on before you and precede you that i may get ready a place for the sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as sultan over the head of his brother sharrkan aright thou reckest answered the wazir then the chamberlain rose up in haste and dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents which he conjured him to accept in similar guise did all the emirs and grandees and officers of state bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him haply thou wilt mention our case to sultan zau almakan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities the chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march whereupon the wazir dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city and they did his bidding then the chamberlain mounted and rode forward full of joy and saying to himself how blessed is this gurney and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes she and her brother zau almakan they made all haste over their wayfare till they reached a place distant a day's journey from baghdad where the chamberlain called a halt for rest and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the sultan zau almakan son of king omar bin alnu'uman while he rode forward with his mamelukes and alighting at a distance from nuzhat alzaman's litter commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence they did so and she gave permission whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother and told them of the death of their father and of zau almakan how the heads of the people had made him king over them in the stead of his sire and he gave them joy of the kingdom they both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed but the chamberlain answered the news rests with the wazir dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host and it only remaineth for thee o king to do what they counsel since they have unanimously chosen thee sultan for if thou do not this they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another sultan haply he will kill thee or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both zau almakan bowed his head awhile and then said i accept this position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharrkan o my son replied the chamberlain thy brother will be sultan of damascus and thou sultan of baghdad so take heart of grace and get ready thy case zau almakan accepted this and the chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger of state which the wazir dandan had brought with him then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion wherein the sultan might sit to receive the emirs and grandees moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs they did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round after awhile the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of baghdad and khorasan a conquering host like the full tide seaand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seventyeighth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their sultan they planted a splendid shhmiynah befitting kings and as they ended their labours behold a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host and presently it appeared that this was the army of baghdad and khorasan preceded by the wazir dandan and in it all rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place now zau almakan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state so the chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot to do him service and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs whilst the chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the shahmiyanah with drawn swords in their hands presently up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the chamberlain went in to zau almakan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them ten by ten the chamberlain acquainted them with the king's commands to which they replied we hear and we obey and all drew up before the pavilion entrance then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of sultan zau almakan whom when they saw they were awed but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good so they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers and they ceased not to enter ten by ten till none was left but the wazir dandan lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau almakan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sire sans peer verily thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the subtle of lere then bade he the chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto so they came and ate and drank moreover the sultan commanded his wazir dandan call a ten days' halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain the wazir obeyed the commands of the sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said this needs must be he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days they did as he bade them and moreover he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the king for service during the space of three days then the wazir went to the sultan and reported all to him and zau almakan waited until nightfall when he went in to his sister nuzhat alzaman and asked her dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not i have no knowledge of the cause she answered and drew a silken curtain before herself whilst zau almakan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the wazir to the presence and when he came said to him i desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire king omar bin alnu'uman know then o king replied dandan that king omar bin al nu'uman when he returned to baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city enquired for thee and thy sister but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the pilgrimage whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings now while we were in attendance upon him one day after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight lo there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee accompanied by five damsels high bosomed virgins like moons endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe and to crown their perfections of comeliness they could read the koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples then that old woman sought audience of the king and he bade admit her whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands i was then sitting by his side and he seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness made her draw near and take seat hard by him and when she had sat down she addressed him and said 'know o king that with me are five damsels whose like no king among the kings possesseth for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection they read the koranand the traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races they stand here between thy hands to do thee service o king of the age and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised 'thy father who hath found mercy looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him so he said to them let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seventyninth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan said unto king zau almakan thy father who hath found mercy glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them 'let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before' thereupon one of them came forward and kissing the ground before him spake as follows 'know o king that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies and observe the divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who if he stray therefrom falleth into perdition for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour and know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting and the right way thereto is the service of allah wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people and swerve not from this canon for the mightier men are in dignity the more their need of prudence and foresight and indeed monarchs need this more than the many for the general cast themselves into affairs without taking thought to the issue thereof be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of allah and know that if an enemy dispute with thee thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him but as for thy friend there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing choose therefore thy friend for thyself after thou hast proved him if he be of the brotherhood of futurity let him be zealous in observing the externals of the holy law and versed in its inner meaning as far as may be and if he be of the brotherhood of the world let him be free born sincere neither a fool nor a perverse for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him and a liar cannot be a true friend indeed the word siddk 'friend' deriveth from sidk 'truth' that welleth up from the bottom of the heart and how can this be the case when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue and know that the observance of the law profiteth him who practiseth it so love thy brother if he be of this quality and do not cast him off even if thou see in him that which irketh thee for a friend is not i like a wife whom one can divorce and remarry nay his heart is like glass once broken it may not be mended and allah bless him who saith'ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart  'tis hard to win thee back the heart offendedfor hearts indeed whence love is alien made  like broken glass may nevermore be mended'the maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say 'the best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men it is also said 'it behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking allah especially for two favours health and reason' again it is said 'whoso honoureth himself his lust is a light matter to him and he who maketh much of his small troubles allah afflicteth him with the greater he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend he who thinketh well of thee do thou fulfill his thought of thee he who exceedeth in contention sinneth and he who against upright standeth not on ward is not safe from the sword now will i tell thee somewhat of the duties of kazis and judges know o king that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant and mediation is admissible between moslems except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful if thou shalt have done aught during the day of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved thou o kazi shouldst revert to the right for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong then o judge thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to allah be he extolled and exalted and require thou proof of the complainant and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it and if not put the defendant to his oath for this is the ordinance of allah receive thou the testimony of competent moslem witnesses one against other for almighty allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals he himself taking charge of the inner and secret things it behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of allah almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people' quoth alzuhri 'there are three things for which if they be found in a kazi he should be deposed namely if he honour the base if he love praise and if he fear dismissal and omar bin abd alaziz once deposed a kazi who asked him 'why hast thou dismissed me it hath reached me' answered omar 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition' it is said also that iskandar said to his kazi 'i have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding' to his cook he said 'thou art the sultan of my body so look thou tender it as thine own self' to his secretary he said 'thou art the controller of my wit so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me' thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forwardand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eightieth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan said to zau almakan thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and kissing the ground seven times before the king thy father spake as follows 'the sage lukmn said to his son 'there be three who are known only in three several cases the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath the brave only in battle and thy friend in time of need' it is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed quoth allah almighty 'assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done and who love to be praised for what they have not done shall escape reckoning of punishment indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty' and he said on whom be salvation and salutation 'works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth' he said also 'in the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound and which being unsound the whole is unsound' and this is the heart now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man since it is that which ordereth his whole affair if covetise stir in it desire destroyeth him and if affliction master it anguish slayeth him if anger rage in it danger is hard upon him if it be blest with contentment he is safe from discontent if fear surprise it he is full of mourning and if calamity overtake it affliction betideth him if a man gain the use of wealth peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his lord if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe or if disquietude waste his heart weakness causeth him to fall thus in any case nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next it was asked of a certain sage 'who is the most ill conditioned of men' and he answered 'the man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth and how excellently saith the poetfreest am i of all mankind fro' meddling wight  who seeing others err self error ne'er can sightriches and talents are but loans to creature lent  each wears the cloak of that he bears in breast and spriteif by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make  thou shalt go wrong and if the door be right go right'continued the maiden 'as for anecdotes of devotees quoth hisham bin bashar 'i asked omar bin ubayd what is true piety' and he answered 'the apostle of allah to whom be salutation and salvation hath explained it when he sayeth the pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead' and it is related that abu zarr used to say want is dearer to me than wealth and unheal is dearer to me than health' quoth one of the listeners 'may allah have mercy on abu zarr' for my part i say 'whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of almighty allah should be content with that condition which allah hath chosen for him' quoth one of the companions of the prophet 'ibn abi aufa once prayed with us the dawn prayer when he had done he recited 'o thou enwrapped' till he came to where allah saith 'when there shall be a trumping on the trumpet' and fell down dead it is said that sabit albanani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes they brought him a man to medicine him who said to him 'i will cure thee provided thou obey my bidding' asked sabit 'in what matter' quoth the leach 'in that thou leave weeping' 'what is the worth of mine eyes' rejoined sabit 'if they do not weep' quoth a man to mohammed bin abdillah 'exhort thou me'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eightyfirst nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan said to zau almakan thus spake the second hand maid to the king who hath found mercy omar bin alnu'uman 'quoth a man to mohammed bin abdillah exhort thou me' 'i exhort thee' replied he 'to be a self ruler an abstainer in this world and in the next a greedy slave' 'how so' asked the other and mohammed answered 'the abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come' and quoth ghaus bin abdillah 'there were two brothers among the sons of israel one of whom said to the other 'what be the most perilous thing thou hast done' replied the brother 'i once came upon a nest of young birds so i took out one and threw it back into the nest but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it this is the most perilous thing i ever did now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done' he rejoined 'when i arise for prayer i am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward' now their father heard these words and exclaimed 'o allah an say they sooth take them to thyself' it was declared by one of the wise men 'verily these were of the most virtuous of children' quoth sa'd bin jubayr 'i was once in company with fuzalah bin 'ubaydand said to him 'exhort thou me replied he 'bear in mind these two necessaries shun syntheism and harm not any of allah's creatures' and he repeated these two couplets'be as thou wilt for allah still is bounteous lord  and care dispeller dread not therefore bane and banto two things only never draw thee nigh nor give  partner to allah trouble to thy brother man'and how well saith the poet'an thou of pious works a store neglect  and after death meet one who did collectthou shalt repent thou diddest not as he  nor madest ready as he did elect'then the third damsel came forward after the second had with drawn and said 'of a truth the chapter of piety is exceeding wide but i will mention what occurreth to me thereof concerning the pious of old quoth a certain holy man 'i congratulate myself in death though i am not assured of rest therein save that i know death interveneth between a man and his works so i hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works' and ita'a al salami when he had made an end of an exhortation was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore and as they asked him why he did this he answered 'i desire to enter upon a grave matter and it is the standing up before almighty allah to do in accordance with my exhortation' in similar guise zayn alabidn son of alhusayn was wont to tremble when he rose to pray being asked the cause of this he replied 'know ye not before whom i stand and whom i address' it is said that there lived near sufyn althauri a blind man who when the month of ramazan came went out with the folk to pray but remained silent and hung back said sufyan 'on the day of resurrection he shall come with the people of the koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows' quoth sufyan 'were the soul established in the heart as befitteth it would fly away for joy and pining for paradise and for grief and fear of hellfire' it is related also of sufyan althauri that he said 'to look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin' then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth who said 'here am i to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me it is related that bishr barefoot said 'i once heard khlid say 'beware of secret polytheism' i asked 'what may secret polytheism be' and he answered 'when one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity come upon him' and one of the sages said 'doing works of weal expiateth what is ill' quoth ibrahim 'i supplicated bishr barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries but he said 'o my son this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one of every hundred five even as the legal alms upon money' said ibrahim 'i thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while i was praying behold bishr was also praying so i stood behind him making the prayer bow till the mu'ezzin called his call then rose a man of tattered appearance and said o folk beware of a truth which bringeth unweal for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal and in time of need no choice we heed speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good presently i saw bishr drop a danik so i picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which i gave him quoth he 'i will not take it' quoth i 'it is perfectly lawful change' but he rejoined 'i cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world' it is related also that bishr barefoot's sister once went to ahmad bin hanbaland shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eightysecond nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan continued to bespeak zau almakan on this wise and quoth the maiden to thy father 'bishr barefoot's sister once went to ahmad bin hanbal and said to him 'o imam of the faith we are a family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light is this forbidden to us' asked ahmad'who are thou' 'i am the sister of bishr barefoot' answered she rejoined the iman 'o household of bishr i shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts' quoth one of the sages 'when allah willeth well to his servant he openeth upon him the gate of action' mlik bin dinr when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired was wont to say 'o soul take patience for i will not accord to thee what thou desirest' he said also allah accept him 'the salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it and its damnation in submission to it' quoth mansr bin ammr 'i made a pilgrimage and was faring meccahwards by way of cufa and the night was overcast when i heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying 'o allah i swear by thy greatness and thy glory i meant not through my disobedience to transgress against thee for indeed i am not ignorant of thee but my fault is one thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning so do thou pardon my transgression for indeed i disobeyed thee of my ignorance' when he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse 'o true believers save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones' then i heard a fall but not knowing what it was i passed on when the morning morrowed as we went our way behold we fell in with a funeral train followed by an old woman whose strength had left her i asked her of the dead and she answered 'this is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the book of allah almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he fell dead' therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said 'i here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time maslamah bin dinr used to say 'by making sound the secret thoughts sins great and small are covered' and 'when the servant of allah is resolved to leave sinning victory cometh to him' also quoth he 'every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to allah is a calamity for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future' it was asked of ab hzim 'who is the most prosperous of men' and he answered 'whoso spendeth his life in submission to allah' the other enquired 'and who is the most foolish of mankind' 'whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others' replied abu hazim it is reported of moses on whom be peace that when he came to the waters of midian he exclaimed 'o lord verily i stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me' and he asked of his lord and not of his folk there came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first when the twain returned they informed their father shu'ayb on whom be peace who said 'haply he is hungry' adding to one of them 'go back to him and bid him hither' now when she came to moses she veiled her face and said 'my father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us' moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her now she was a woman large in the back parts and the wind blowing upon her garment covered the hinder cheeks to moses which when moses saw he lowered his eyes and said to her 'get thee behind while i walk in front' so she followed him till he entered the house of shu'ayb where supper was readyand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eightythird nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan continued to zau almakan now quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire 'when moses on whom be peace entered the home of shu'ayb where supper was ready shu'ayb said to him 'o moses i desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two' but moses answered 'i am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world for what is on earth of gold and silver' then quoth shu'ayb 'o youth nevertheless thou art my guest and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him' so moses sat down and ate then shu'ayb hired moses for eight pilgrimages that is to say eight years and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters and moses' service to him was to stand for her dowry as saith the holy writ of him 'verily i will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages and if thou fulfil ten years it is in thine own breast for i seek not to impose a hardship on thee' a certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days 'thou hast made me desolate for that i have not seen thee this long while' quoth the other 'i have been distracted from thee by ibn shihb dost thou know him' quoth his friend 'yes he hath been my neighbour these thirty years but i have never spoken to him' he replied 'verily thou forgettest allah in forgettingthy neighbour if thou lovedst allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour even as the right of kith and kin' said huzayfah 'we entered meccah with ibrhm bin adham and shakk albalkh was also making a pilgrimage that year now we met whilst circumambulating the ka'abah and ibrahim said to shakik 'what is your fashion in your country' replied shakik 'when we are blest with our daily bread we eat and when we hunger we take patience' 'this wise' said ibrahim 'do the dogs of balkh but we when blest with plenty do honour to allah and when an hungered we thank him' and shakik seated himself before ibrahim and said to him 'thou art my master' also said mohammed bin imrn 'a man once asked of htim the deaf 'what maketh thee to trust in allah' 'two things' answered he 'i know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread so my heart is at rest as to that and i know that i was not created without the knowledge of allah and am abashed before him' then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and kissing the ground before thy father nine times said 'thou hast heard o king what these all have spoken on the subject of piety and i will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times it is said that the imam alshfi' departed the night into three portions the first for study the second for sleep and the third for prayer the imam ab hanfah was wont also to pass half the night in prayer oneday a man pointed him out to another as he walked by and remarked 'yonder man watcheth the whole night' when he heard this abu hanifah said 'i was abashed before allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me' so after this he used to watch the whole night and one of the sages hath said'who seeketh for pearl in the deep dives deep  who on high would hie robs his night of sleep'alrab a relates that alshafi'i used to recite the whole koran seventy times during the month of ramazan and that in his daily prayers quoth alshafi'i allah accept him 'during ten years i never ate my fill of barley bread for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray' it is reported of abdullah bin mohammed alsakr that he said 'i was once talking with omar and he observed to me 'never saw i a more god fearing or eloquent man than mohammed bin idris alshafi'i' it so happened i went out one day with alhris bin labb alsaffr who was a disciple of almuzani and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the almighty 'this shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves' i saw alshafi'i's colour change his skin shuddered with horripilation he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit when he revived he said 'i take refuge with allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent o allah before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves o allah of thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins adorn me with the curtain of thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings by the magnanimity of thy being' then i rose and went away quoth one of the pious 'when i entered baghdad alshafi'i was there so i sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer and behold there passed me one who said 'o youth make thy wuzuablution well and allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next' i turned and lo there was a man behind whom came a company of people so i hastened to finish my ablution and followed him presently he turned and asked me 'say dost thou want aught' 'yes' answered i 'i desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which allah almighty hath taught thee' he said 'know then that whoso believeth in allah shall be saved and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death shall i tell thee any more' i replied 'assuredly' and he continued 'be thou of the world that is heedless and of the world to come greediest be truthful in all thy dealings and thou shalt be saved with the salvationists' then he went on and i asked about him and was told that he was the imam alshafi'i alshafi'i was wont to remark 'i love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to meand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eightyfourth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan continued to zau almakan the old woman bespake thy sire saying 'the imam alshafi'i was wont to remark i love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me' he also said 'i never disputed with any one but i would that almighty allah should give him the knowledge of the truth and aid him to dispread it nor did i ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the truth and i reck not whether allah manifest it by my tongue or by his' he said also whom allah accept 'if thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore then bethink thee whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest' it was told to abu hanfah that the commander of the faithful ab ja'afar almansr had appointed him kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams but he would not accept of this and when the day came on which the money was to be paid him he prayed the dawn prayer then covered his head with his robeand spoke not when the caliph's messenger came with the money he went in to the imam and accosted him but he would not speak to him so the messenger said 'verily this money is lawfully thine' 'i know that it is lawfully mine' replied he 'but i abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart' asked the other 'if thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them' answered abu hanifah 'can i look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet' another of alshafi'i's sayings allah accept him is'oh soul of me an thou accept my rede  thou shalt be wealthy and of grace entirecast off ambitious hopes and vain desires  how many a death was done by vain desire'among the sayings of sufyn althaur with which he admonished ali bin alhasan alsalami was 'be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride be not indebted save to him who is merciful to his debtors and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of allah and in beseeching of allah peace for what remaineth of thy life counsel every true believer when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith and beware of betraying a believer for whoso betrayeth a believer betrayeth allah and his apostle avoid dissensions and litigation and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt so shalt thou be at peace enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence so shalt thou be loved of allah adorn thine inner man and allah shall adorn thine outer man accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the moslems draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee so shalt thou be the friend of the prophets let thine affairs both public and private be in allah's charge and fear him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards resurrection and judgement stead between the hands of the lord of dread and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped either for heavens eterne or to the hell fires that burn' thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels now when thy father who hath found mercy heard their discourse he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time and seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore he showed them all favour moreover he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged princess abrizah daughter of the king of greece to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed they abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them and whenever the king visited them he found her absorbed in prayer watching by night and fasting by day whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me 'o wazir verily this old woman is of the pious and awe of her is strong in my heart' now on the eleventh day the king visited her that he might pay her the price of the damsels but she said to him 'o king know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men indeed i seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels be it little or much' now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her 'o my lady and what is their price' whereto she answered 'i will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast watching by night a whole month and abstaining by day all for the love of allah almighty and if thou do this they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please' so the king wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation she was magnified in his eyes and he said 'allah make this pious woman to profit us' then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated and she said to him 'i will help thee with the prayers i pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water' they brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof lastly she covered it with a cloth and sealing it with her signet ring gave it to thy sire saying 'when thou hast fasted the first ten days break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith as for me tomorrow i will go forth to my brethren the invisible controuls for i yearn after them and i will return to thee when the first ten days are past thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace then locked the door and put the key in his pocket next day the king fasted and the old woman went her waysand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eightyfifth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan thus continued to zau almakan now when came the day for the sultan's fast the old woman went her ways and after he had accomplished the ten days thereof on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf like no leaf of known tree she went in to thy sire and saluted him and when he saw her he rose to her saying 'welcome o pious lady' 'o king' quoth she 'the invisible controuls salute thee for i told them of thee and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their halw which is of the sweetmeats of the other world do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day' the king rejoiced at this with great joy and exclaimed 'praised be allah who hath given me brethren of the invisible world' thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour she went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said 'know o king that i told the invisible controuls of the love which is between me and thee and informed them how i had left the maidens with thee and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a king like thee for they were wont when they saw them to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted so i would fain carry them to the invisible controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour and peradventure they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth that thou after completing thy fast mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee to the extent of thy desires' when thy sire heard her words he thanked her for them and said 'except that i fear to cross thee i would not accept the treasure or aught else but when wilt thou set out with them' replied she 'on the seven and twentieth night and i will bring them back to thee at the head of the month by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal by allah each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom' he said 'i know it o pious lady' then quoth the old woman 'there is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the invisible controuls' quoth he 'i have a greek slave called sophia by whom i have been blessed with two children a girl and a boy but they were lost years ago take her with thee that she may get the blessing'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eightysixth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan continued to zau almakan quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him 'i have a greek slave called sophia by whom i have been blest with two children a girl and a boy but they were lost years ago so take her with thee haply she may get the benediction and belike the invisible controuls will sue allah for her that her two children may be restored to her' 'thou hast said well' replied she 'for that indeed was her grievousest want' thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him 'o my son i am going to the invisible controuls so bring me sophia' accordingly he summoned her and she came forthright and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup presented it to the sultan saying 'on the thirtieth day do thou repair to the hammam and when thou comest out enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup then sleep and thou shalt attain what thou seekest and peace be with thee' thereat the king was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands quoth she 'i commend thee to allah's care' whereat quoth he 'and when shall i see thee again o pious lady in very sooth i love not to part with thee' then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the queen whilst the king fasted after her departure other three days till the month ended when he arose and went to the hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace commanding that none should go in to him there after making fast the door he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day but he did not come out and we said 'perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day wherefore he sleepeth' so we waited till next day but still he did not come forth then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter but nothing came of that so at last we lifted up the door and going in found him dead with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken when we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed 'whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of kings and who debaucheth them and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that sharrkan when he came to our country seduced our queen abrizah nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you then he sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts this be no kingly deed and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited so do ye suspect none of having killed him for no one slew him but the cunning witch whose name is zat aldawahi and behold i have taken the king's wife sophia and have carried her to her father afridun king of constantinople moreover there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you and ye shall be cut off even to the last man nor shall a living soul be spared by death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath save he who cross and belt worshippeth' when we read this paper we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught and the troops fell out as to whom they should make sultan some would have thee and others would have thy brother sharrkan and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother sharrkan so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee and such is the manner of the death of sultan omar bin alnu'uman now when the wazir dandan had made an end of his story zau al makan and his sister nuzhat alzaman wept and the chamberlain who wept also said to zau almakan o king weeping will avail thee naught nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead thereupon zau almakan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him and the chamberlain sat by his side and all the armourbearers behind him whilst the wazir dandan and the rest of the emirs and grandees stood each in his individual stead then quoth king zau almakan to the minister dandan inform me concerning my sire's treasures and he replied i hear and i obey and gave him to know of the late king's hoards and monies and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels and acquainted him with other precious things so zau almakan opened his hand to the army and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the wazir dandan saying thou continues in office whereupon dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life then he bestowed dresses on the emirs after which he said to the chamberlain bring out before me the tribute of damascus that is with thee so he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels when he took them and parted them all amongst the troopsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eightyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that zau al makan ordered the chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of damascus and when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels he took them and parted them all amongst the troops till nothing was left and the emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life saying never saw we a king who gave the like of these gifts then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching so they marched for three days till on the fourth day they drew near to baghdad when they entered the city they found it decorated and zau almakan the sultan went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne whilst the emirs of the army and the wazir dandan and the chamberlain of damascus stood between his hands then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother sharrkan acquainting him with all that had passed from first to last and he concluded as soon as thou hast read this letter make ready thine affair and join us with thine army that we may turn to holy war upon the infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the minister dandan none shall carry this letter but thou and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him 'if thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom it is thine and thy brother shall be viceroy for thee in damascus for to this effect am i instructed by him' so the wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march then zau almakan bade set apart a magnificent house for the fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that fireman presently zau almakan went out chasing and hunting and as he was returning to baghdad one of the emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades one of the damsels pleased him so he went in unto her and knew her that night and she conceived by him forthright after a while the wazir dandan returned from his journey bringing him news of his brother sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him and said it were fitting thou go forth to meet him zau al makan replied i hear and i consent and riding forth with his grandees a day's journey from baghdad he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother next morning appeared king sharrkan amid the army of syria a horseman of might a lion fierce in fight a prow and doughty knight as the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high zau almakan and those with him pushed forward to meet sharrkan and his men and when zau almakan saw his brother he desired to dismount but sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise and himself footed it and walked a few paces towards him as soon as he reached zau almakan the new sultan threw himself upon him and sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other then they mounted and rode onward they and their troops till they reached baghdad where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night and when next morning came zau al makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts and proclaimed a holy war and a razzia they then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good till in so doing a full month had sped and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body then sharrkan said to zau almakan o my brother tell me thy history so he told him all that had befallen him from first to last including the benevolent dealing of the fireman with him asked sharrkan 'hast thou requited his kindness and he answered o my brother i have not rewarded him as yet but inshallah i will recompense him whenas i return from this raidand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eightyeighth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan asked his brother zau almakan hast thou requited the fireman for his kindness and he answered o my brother i have not rewarded him as yet but inshallah i will recompense him whenas i return from this raid and find time so to do therewith sharrkan was certified that his sister nuzhat alzaman had told him the whole truth but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the chamberlain she sent him back her greeting calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter kuziafakan to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety where upon she praised almighty allah and gave him thanks then sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure and zau almakan said o my brother as soon as the army is complete and the arabs have come in from all parts we will march forth so he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife who was now five months gone with child and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians to whom he appointed stipends and allowances then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of syria and as soon as the arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions and as he fared forth he was followed by the warriors and the united host now the name of the general of the daylam army was rustam and that of the general of the army of the turks bahram and zau al makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother sharrkan and on his left the chamberlain his brotherinlaw so the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array till the whole army was in motion they ceased not to fare on for the space of a month and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days for the host was great and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the greeks then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to constantinople but when king afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to zat aldawahi the same who had contrived the stratagem and had travelled to baghdad and had slain king omar bin alnu'uman and who after carrying off her slaves and queen sophia had returned with them all to her native land now when she had been restored to her son the king of greece and felt herself safe she said to king hardub cool thine eyes for i have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter abrizah and have killed omar bin alnu'uman and have brought back sophia so now let us go to the king of constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces and i will fare with thee to king afridun lord of constantinople for i opine that the moslems will not await our attack said hardub tarry thou till they draw near our country that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war and when the news of the moslems' advance reached them they were prepared for defence and zat al dawahi had preceded them now when she and her son arrived at constantinople the king of kings afridun hearing of the approach of hardub king of the greeks came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit so hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother zat aldawahi how she had slain the moslem king and recovered from him queen sophia and had said the moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them now king afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of king omar bin alnu'uman and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the moslem king so the nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the greeks was complete besides which there joined themselves to him franks from all their lands french germans and ragusans with men of zara venetians genoese and all the hosts of the yellow faces and when the gathering was at its full earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude then afridun the great king ordered a march so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days they fared on till they reached the wady highs alnu'uman a broad sided vale hard by the salt sea where they halted three days and on the fourth they were about to set out again when news came that the army of alislam on them press and the defenders of the faith of mohammed of men the best so they halted in it other three days and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades presently there appeared beneath it the banners islamitan and the ensigns mahometan the horsemen urged forward like the letting loose of seas that surged clad in mail as they were mackerelback clouds which the moon enveil whereupon the two hosts clashed like two torrents on each other dashed eyes fell upon eyes and the first to seek combat singular was the wazir dandan he and the army of syria numbering thirty thousand bridles and with him were the general of the turks and the general of daylam rustam and bahram amid twenty thousand horse behind whom came the men from the shores of the salt sea clad in iron mail as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast then the nazarene host called out on jesus and mary and the defiled cross and they heaped themselves upon the wazir dandan and those with him of the syrian host now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman zat aldawahi for before his departure king afridun had gone in to her and asked her how shall i do and what plan shall i pursue it is thou hast caused this great distress to us and she had answered o great king and mighty cohen i will teach thee a trick would baffle iblis himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hostsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eightyninth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman for that the king before his departure had gone to her and asked how shall i do and what plan shall i pursue it is thou hast caused this great distress to us and she had answered o great king and mighty cohen i will teach thee a trick would baffle the devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts it is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships and sailing over the sea to the mountain of smoke and there let them land and stir not till he standards of alislam come upon thee when do thou up and at them then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the moslems and take them in rear whilst we confront them from the landward so not one of them shall escape and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to king afridun and he replied right is the recking thou reckest o princess of wits and recourse of kings and cohens warring for their blood wit so when the army of alislam came upon them in chat valley before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents then hurried up the army of baghdad and khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse with zau almakan in the front of war when the host of the infidels that lay by the sea saw them they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks and when zau al makan espied this he cried out to his men turn back to the infidels o people of the chosen apostle and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the compassionating the compassionate so they turned and fought with the christians then sharrkan marched up with another corps of the moslem host some hundred thousand men whilst the infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men when the moslems were united their hearts were strengthened and they cried out saying verily allah hath pro mised us victory and to the infidels hath assigned defeat and they clashed together with sword and spear now sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword shouting allaho akbar allah is most great till he drove back the host to the coast then failed the force of the foe and allah gave victory to the faith of alislam and folk fought folk drunken without strong drink till they slew of the infidels in this affair forty and five thousand while of the moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell moreover the lion of the faith king sharrkan and his brother zau almakan slept not that night but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come thus far concerning the moslem but as regards king afridun lord of constantinople and sovran of roum and zat aldawahi they assembled the emirs of the host and said to them verily we had worked our will and solaced our hearts but our over confidence in our numbers and that only defeated us then quoth to them the ancient one the lady of calamities in very sooth nought shall profit you except ye draw you nigh unto the messiah and put your trust in the true belief for by the virtue of the messiah the whole strength of the moslem host lieth in that satan king sharrkan tomorrow said king afridun i have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier lk bin shamlt for if king sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed our man will slay him and will slay the other moslem knights till not one is left and i purpose this night to sacre you all with the holy incense when the emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the chief patriarch the denier the defiler of the truth and they sought for it with such instance and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the greeks used to send it to all the countries of the christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris hearing of it kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal and the chief priests and the great kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic and the patriarchs used to mix their own skite with it for that the skite of the chief patriarch could not suffice for ten countries so as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and king afridunand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the ninetieth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and king afridun summoned his chief knights and nobles and invested them with dresses of honour and drawing the sign of the cross on their brows incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the chief patriarch the cohen the heresiarch this incensing done he called for luka bin shamlut surnamed the sword of the messiah and after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the holy merde caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest now there was no stouter champion in the land of roum than this accursed luka nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir but he was foul of favour for his face was as the face of an ass his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness and he was branded with the mark of the infidels on face after this he came up to king afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him and the king said to him i desire thou go out against sharrkan king of damascus son of omar bin alnu'uman and deliver us from this affliction quoth luka hearkening and obedience and the king made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from heaven being near hand then luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels and he bore a trident spear as he were iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign then he rode forward he and his horde of infidels even as though they were driving to the fire preceded by a herald crying aloud in the arabic tongue and saying ho sect of mohammed upon whom be salutation and salvation let none of you come out but your champion sharrkan the sword of alislam lord of damascus in shm nor had he made an end of speaking when arose a tumult in the plain all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the day of complain then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound and lo it was king sharrkan son of king omar bin alnu'uman for when his brother zau almakan saw that accursed one push out on the plain and heard the pursuivant he turned to sharrkan and said to him of a surety they seek for thee said he should it so be 'twere most pleasing to me so when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain let none of you come out against me save sharrkan they knew this cursed luka to be champion of the land of roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of moslems now he was one of the greatest of villains a wretch who caused hearts to pain and the dayiamites turks and kurds dreaded his might and main presently sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake and recited these coupletsi have a sorrel steed whose pride is fain to bear the rein  shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his maini have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point  upon whose shaft the dam of death her throny seat hath ta'eni have a trenchant glaive of hind and when i bare its face  of scabbard veil from out its brow the rays of levee rainluka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse but he smote his forehead with his hand in honour of the cross drawn thereon and kissed it then he couched his throw spear and ran at sharrkan but first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight and catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers hurled it at sharrkan it flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for sharrkan but as the spear flew near him he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view as it descended he caught it again with the other hand in less than the twinkling of an eye and cried out from his heart core saying by the truth of him who created the sevenfold skies i will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise then threw he the throw spear at luka who thought to do as sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight but sharrkan prevented him and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead in the very centre of the sign of the cross and allah hurried his soul to the fire and dwelling place dire but when the infidels saw luka bin shamlut fall slain they buffeted their faces and they cried alas and woe worth the day and called for aid upon the abbots of the monasteriesand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the ninetyfirst nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the infidels saw luka bin shamlut fall slain they buffeted their faces and cried alas and woe worth the day and called upon the abbots of the monasteries and cried where be the crosses so the religious offered up prayers and the christians all drew together against sharrkan and brandishing their scymitars and lances rushed forward to the attack then army met army and breasts fell under hoof whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legs nor did the herald ofwar cease calling to fight till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight so the two hosts drew apart whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave for that with so much cut and thrust they strave and the place was choked with the slain fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell then sharrkan joined his brother zau almakan and the chamberlain and the wazir dandan and said to them verily allah hath opened a door for the infidels to fall praised be the lord of the worlds one and all replied zau almakan let us never cease to praise allah for that he hath dispelled trouble from the arab and the ajam indeed the folk generation after generation shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed luka the falsifier of the evangel of thy catching the throng spear in midflight and how the enemy of allah among men thou didst smite and thy fame shall endure until the end of time then said sharrkan harkye o grand chamberlain and doughty capitayne and he answered adsum quoth sharrkan take with thee the wazir dandan and twenty thousand horse and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the infidels disembarking from their ships and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them and whenso ye see our troops falling back as if defeated and all the infidels following them as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents do ye still lie in wait for them but as soon as ye see the standard with the words there is no god but the god and mohammed is god's apostle on whom be salutation and salvation then up with the green banner and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout 'alla ho akbar allah is most great' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea he replied to hear is to obey and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth now the chamberlain took with himself the wazir dandan and twenty thousand men even as sharrkan had commanded as soon as dawned the morn the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear then the christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the ecclesiasts cried out and all heads were bared and those in the ships hoisted the cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white and all joined fight and the grind mill of death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore the host of alislam called out saying on the prince of mankind be blessings and peace and to the compassionate glory and praise which ne'er shall cease for his boons which aye increase and the host of the infidels shouted glory to the cross and the belt and the vine press juice and the wine presser and the priests and the monks and the festival of palms and the metropolitan now zau almakan and sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy while the infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout and made ready to foin and hew then the meiny of the moslems raised their voices reciting the first verses of the chapter of the cow whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds and the heralds of the greeks cried out ho servants of the messiah ho people of the true faith ho followers of the primate verily divine grace upon you opes for see the hosts of al islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope so turn ye not to them your backs but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them else are ye outcasts from the messiah mary's son who spoke even when a cradled one now afridun king of constantinople deemed that the infidels were victorious knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the moslems and sent to king hardub of roum congratulations on success adding availed us naught but the holy merde of the arch patriarch whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the cross near and far and i swear by the miracles of the messiah and by thy daughter abrizah the nazarene the mariolater and by the waters of baptism that i will not leave upon the earth a single defender of al islam and to the bitter end will i carry out this plan so the messenger betook himself with the address to king hardub whilst the infidels called to one another saying take we vengeance wreak for lukaand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the ninetysecond nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the infidels called to one another saying take we vengeance wreak for luka while hardub king of greece cried aloud ho to our revenge for abrizah thereupon king zau almakan shouted ho servants of the requiting king smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear so the moslems returned to the infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar whilst their herald cried aloud up and at the foes of the faith all ye who love the prophet elect with hope of salvation on the day of fear to win favour of the bountiful the forgiving one for verily the garden of paradise is under the shadow of swords and behold sharrkan and his men charged down upon the infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks when lo a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the deniers cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks so that the faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew he was girt with two swords his glances and his brand and he was armed with two lances one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors even as saith the poetlaud not long hair except it be dispread  in two fold locks on day of fight and frayo'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh  from many a whis kered knight to win the dayand as singeth anotheri say to him what while he slings his sword  'for sword shall serve those looks that sword like show'says he 'my sabre looks for those i love  my sword for those who sweets of love unknow'when sharrkan saw him he said to him i conjure thee by the koran and the attributes of the compassionate one o champion of the champions tell me who thou art for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the requiting king whom one thing distracteth not from other thing in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling then cried the cavalier to him saying thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday how quickly thou hast forgotten me thereupon he withdrew his mouth veil so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed and lo it was none other than zau almakan then sharrkan rejoiced in his brother save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting and this for two reasons the first his tender age and exposure to the evil eye and the second that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings so he said to him o king thou riskest thy life so join thy steed to mine in very sooth i fear for thee from the foe and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft quoth zau almakan i desire to even thee in fray and i will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay then the host of alislam heaping itself upon the infidels girt them on all sides warred on them a right holy war and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre but king afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the greek and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight making for the ships when lo there came out upon them from the seacoast another host led by the minister dandan the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust and to lay load on them with cut and thrust nor less came forth the emir bahram lord of the provinces of sham amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm and the host of alislam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm then a body of the moslems turned against those who in the ships remained and perdition on them rained till they threw themselves into the main and they slew of them many slain more than a hundred thousand noblemen nor was one of their champions great or small saved from bale and bane moreover they took their ships with all the money and treasure and cargo save a score of keel and the moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic whereat the moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that allah had given them victory and protection such was the case with them but as regards the fugitive infidels they soon reached constantinople whither the tidings preceded them that king afridun had prevailed over the moslems so quoth the ancient dame zat aldawahi i know that my son hardub king of roum is no runagate and that he feareth not the islamitic hosts but will restore the whole world to the nazarene faith then she bade the great king afridun give command that the city be decorated and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of destiny now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings behold the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the king of csarea so king afridun lord of constantinople met them on the sea shore and they told him all that had befallen them from the moslem and they wept sore and groaned and moaned and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal and they informed him concerning luka son of shamlut how calamity had betided him and how death had shot him with his shaft thereat the horrors of doomday rose upon king afridun and he knew that there was no making straight their crook then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening and sighs and cries were heard from all sides and when king hardub of greece met king afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit and said to him look not to see any of the army save those who have already reached thee when king afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit with his nose under his feet and as soon as he revived he exclaimed surely the messiah was wroth with them that he caused the moslems to prevail over them then came the arch patriarch sadly to the king who said to him o our father annihilation hath overtaken our army and the messiah hath punished us replied the patriarch grieve not nor feel concerned for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the messiah and all have been punished for his offence but now we will read prayers for you in the churches that the mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you after which the old woman zat aldawahi came to afridun and said to him o king verily the moslem hosts are many and we shall never overcome them save by wile wherefore i purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of alislam haply i may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion even as i slew his father if my stratagem succeed in his case not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land for all are strong only because of him but i desire to have some christian dwellers of syria such as go out every month and year to sell their goods that they may help me for this they can do in carrying out my plan replied the king be it so whenever thou wilt so she bade fetch an hundred men natives of najrn in sham and the king asked them have ye not heard what hath befallen the christians with the moslems yes answered they and he rejoined know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the messiah and purposeth to go forth with you disguised as monotheists and mohammedans to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the moslem from us say then are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the anointed and i will give you a quintal of gold he of you who escapeth shall have the money and him of you who dieth will the messiah reward o king replied they we will devote our lives to the messiah and we will be thy sacrifice thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted she waited till the decoction was cold then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith moreover she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary and afterwards went in to king afridun who knew her not nor did any of his companions know her till she discovered herself to them and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning and her son rejoiced and said may the messiah never fail thee thereupon she took with her the syrian christians and set out for the army of baghdad and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the ninetythird nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king afridun heard these words he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet and as soon as he revived fear fluttered the scrotum below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame zat aldawahi now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches past mistress in sorcery and deception wanton and wily deboshed and deceptious with foul breath red eyelids yellow cheeks dull brown face eyes bleared mangy body hair grizzled back humped skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran but she had studied the scriptures of alislam and had made the pilgrimage to the holy house of meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the koran and she had professed judaism in the holy city of jerusalem for two years' space that she might master the magic of men and demons so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son king hardub of greece was on account of the slave virgins at his court for she was given to tribadism and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad so if any damsel pleased her she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffron till she fainted away for excess of volupty whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy and so she abode for a length of time this was known to marjanah and rayhnah and utrijah the handmaids of abrizah and their princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her because of the rank smell from her armpits the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre she was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions but abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the omnipotent the omniscient for by allah right well quoth the poetho thou who grovellest low before the great  nor over fording lesser men dost blenchwho gildest dross by dirham gathering  no otter scent disguises carrion stenchand now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working presently she departed taking the chief nazarenes with their hosts and turned towards the army of the moslems whereupon king hardub went in to king afridun and said to him o king we have no need of the chief patriarch nor of his prayers but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the moslem hosts for these are marching with all their power they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides when king afridun heard this terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters without stay or delay to all the nations of the nazarenes saying it behoveth none of the messiahites or cross knights to hold back especially the folk of the strongholds and forts but let them all come to us foot and horse women and children for the moslem hosts already tread our soil so haste haste ye ere what we fear to us here appear thus much concerning them but regarding the work of the old woman zat aldawahi when she went forth from the city with her suite she clad them in the clothing of moslem merchants having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of antioch such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth and she had taken a letter from king afridun to the following effect these be merchantmen from the land of sham who have been with us so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance nor take tax and tithe of them till they reach their homes and safe places for by merchants a country flourisheth and these are no men of war nor of ill faith then quoth the accursed zat aldawahi to those with her verily i wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the moslem replied they o queen command us whatso thou wilt we are at thy disposal and may the messiah never disappoint thy dealings then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion so that it shone with prodigious sheen now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed and she bound her legs tightly round with cords just above her feet till she drew near the moslem camp when she unwound them leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating and set her in a chest and quoth she cry abroad the refrain of unity nor fear from it aught of damage replied they how can we beat thee who be our sovereign lady zat aldawahi mother of the king we glory in then said she we blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes and in need evil becometh good deed when ye have set me in the chest take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the moslem camp and fear ye no blame and if any of the moslems hinder you give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their king zau almakan and implore his protection saying 'we were in the land of the infidels and they took nothing from us but wrote us a passport that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance' if he ask you 'what profit had ye of your property in the land of roum' answer him 'we profited in the deliverance of a pious man who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years crying out for help yet none helped him nay the infidels tortured him night and day we knew not this but after we had tarried in constantinople for some time having sold our goods and bought others in their stead we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land we spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it behold it moved and said 'o moslems is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the lord of the three worlds' 'how so' asked we and the figure answered 'know that allah hath made me speak to you to the intent that your faith be fortified and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the infidels and repair to the moslem host for with them wones the sword of the com passionate one of our age the champion king sharrkan by whom he shall conquer constantinople town and destroy the sect of the nazarene and when ye shall have journeyed three days you will find an hermitage known as the hermitage of the ascetic matruhina and containing a cell visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will for therein is a religious from the holy city jerusalem by name abdullah and he is one of the devoutest of mankind endowed with the power of working saintly miracles such as dispel doubts and obscurity certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time by his deliverance you will please the lord of faithful men for such release is better than fighting for the faith' now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words she said as soon as that which i impart shall reach the ears of king sharrkan say him further 'hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the ninetyfourth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the old woman zat aldawahi and those with her had agreed upon such words she said now as soon as that which i impart shall reach the ears of king sharrkan say him further 'hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and allah's servants of purest qualities so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling as is the wont of merchants as soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon and we heard the holy man after chanting some verses of the koran repeat the following couplets'my heart disheartened is my breast is strait  and sinks my soul in sea of bale and bateunless escape be near i soon shall die  and death were better than this doleful straito lightning an thou light my home and folk  an their still brighter charms thy shine abatesay what my path to meet them being barred  by wars and barricado'd succour's gate'when once ye have brought me into the moslem camp and i mix with them you shall see the old woman continued how i will make shift to beguile them and slay them all even to the last man the nazarenes hearing whet she said kissed her hands and set her in the chest after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this then they all made for the moslem host as hath erst been said such was the case with the damned hag zat aldawahi and her companions but as regards the mohammeden army they indeed after allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards all sat down to converse with one another and zau almakan said to his brother sharrkan verily allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves wherefore continue o sharrkan to obey my commandment in submission to allah be he exalted and extolled for i mean to slay ten kings in blood revenge for my sire to cut the throat of fifty thousand greeks and to enter constantinople replied sharrkan my life be thy ransom against death needs must i follow out the holy war though i wone many a year in their country but i have o my brother in damascus a daughter named kuzia fakan whom i love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age' said zau almakan and i also have left my wife with child and near her time nor do i know what allah will vouchsafe me by her but promise me o my brother that if allah bless me with a son thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon with love and good will replied sharrkan and stretching out his hand to his brother he said if she bring thee a son i will give him my daughter kuzia fakan to wife at this zau almakan rejoiced and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy and the wazir dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them know o ye kings that allah hath given us the victory for that we have devoted our lives to him be he exalted and ex tolled and we have left our homes and households and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him so haply allah shall enable us to win our wishes and we shall destroy our enemies branch and root if it please you do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight and the minister dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who saidto slay my foes is chiefest bliss i wist  and on the courser's back be borne a listcomes promising tryst a messenger from friend  full oft when comes the friend withouten trystand these words of anotherwar for my mother an i live i'll take  spear for my brother scymitar for sirewith every shag haired brave who meets his death  smiling till won from doom his dear desireand when the wazir ended his verses he said praise be to him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold then zau almakan commanded the army to depart and they fared on forcing their marches for constantinople till they came to a wide and spacious champaign full of all things fair and fain with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were paradise for it had donned its adornments and decked itself gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew and combined with the nectar of tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty even as saith the poetbehold this lovely garden 'tis as though  spring o'er its frame her greeny cloak had spreadlooking with fleshly eyne thou shalt but sight  a lake whose waters balance in their bedbut look with spirit eyes and lo shalt see  glory in every leaf o'erwaves thy headand as another saiththe stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed  whose down is creeping shade of tamarisk stemsround legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings  silvern and blossoms are the diademswhen zau almakan saw this champaign with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling he called to his brother sharrkan and said o my brother verily in damascus is naught the like of this place we will not march from it save after three days that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of alislam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed infidels so they halted therein and while camping behold they heard a noise of voices from afar and zau almakan asked the cause thereof and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the land of syria had halted there to rest and that the moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the infidels after a while up came the merchants crying out and appealing to the king for aidance when zau al makan saw this he bade them be brought before him and when in presence they said to him o king we have been in the country of the infidels and they plundered us of nothing why then do our brothers the moslems despoil our goods and we in their own land of a truth when we saw your troops we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the king of constantinople and sharrkan read it and said we will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the infidels replied they o our lord in very sooth allah despatched us thither that we might win what ghzi never won the like of not even thou in all thy razzias asked sharrkan what was it ye won o king answered they we will not tell thee save in private for if this matter be noised among the folk haply it may come to the ears of some and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all moslems who resort to the land of the greeks now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned zat al dawahi so zau almakan and his brother brought them to a private place where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two kings weepand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the ninetyfifth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the nazarenes who wore merchants' weed when brought to a private place by zau almakan and his brother sharrkan laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch zat aldawahi thereupon sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of almighty allah so quoth he to them did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage quoth they we delivered him and slew the hermit fearing for our lives after which we made haste to fly for dread of death but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman as she were a cassia pod for excess of blackness and leanness and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles when zau almakan and the bystanders saw her they took her for a man of the best of allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face so zau almakan and sharrkan wept sore then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet sobbing aloud but she signed to them and said cease this weeping and hear my words hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding and she said know ye both that i was content to accept what my lord did unto me for i kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from him be he exalted and extolled and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation for him there is no coming to the delights of paradise i had indeed supplicated him that i might return to my native land not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me but that i might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the faith who being slain in fray live again without suffering death then she repeated the following coupletsour fort is tor and flames the fire of fight  moses art thou and this is time for aidcast down thy rod 'twill swallow all they wrought  nor dread for men their ropes be vipers madefor chapters read on fight day lines of foes  and on their necks 'grave versets wi' thy bladewhen the old woman had ended her verse her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light and sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her but she refused it saying i have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years and how should i break it at such a time when my lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire i will wait till sun down so when it was nightfall sharrkan and zau almakan came and served her with food and said eat o ascetic but she said this is no time for eating it is the time for worshipping the requiting king then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights sitting not but at the time of the salm or salutation ending with several prayers when zau al makan saw her on this wise firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to sharrkan cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this religious and appoint a body servant to wait upon him on the fourth day she called for food so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt then she again turned to her fast and as the night came she rose anew to pray when sharrkan said to zau almakan verily this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing and were it not for this holy war i would join myself to him and worship allah in his service till i came before his presence and now i desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour quoth zau almakan and i also tomorrow we sally forth to fight against constantinople and we shall find no time like the present said the wazir dandan and i no less desire to see this ascetic haply he will pray for me that i find death in this holy war and come to the presence of my lord for i am aweary of the world so as soon as night had darkened they repaired to the tent of that witch zat aldawahi and seeing her standing to pray they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation then she turned to them and after wishing them long life asked them wherefore come ye whereto they answered o thou holy man diddest thou not hear us weep around thee she rejoined to him who standeth in the presence of allah remaineth no existence in time either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him quoth they we would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night for that will profit us more than the possession of constantinople now when she heard their words she said by allah were ye not the emirs of the moslems i would not relate to you aught of this at any time for i complain not but to allah alone however to you i will relate the circumstances of my captivity know then that i was in the saintly city of jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men and did not magnify myself among them for that allah be he exalted and extolled had endowed me with humility and abnegation till i chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water then entered into me pride whence i know not and i said to myself 'who like me can walk the water' and my heart from that time hardened and allah afflicted me with the love of travel so i journeyed to roum land and visited every part for a whole year and left no place but therein i worshiped allah when i came to this spot i clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage inhabited by a monk called matrubina who when he sighted me came out and kissed my hands and feet and said 'verily i have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the greeks and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of alislam' then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage and brought me to a dark room and when i entered it unawares he locked the door on me and left me there forty days without meat or drink for it was his intent to kill me by delay it chanced one day that a knight called dakians came to the hermitage accompanied by ten squires and his daughter tamsil a girl whose beauty was incom parable when they entered that hermitage the monk matruhina told them of me and the knight said 'bring him out for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat' so they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche praying and reciting the koran and glorifying allah and humbling myself before the almighty when they saw me in this state matrohina exclaimed 'this man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers' and hearing his words they all came in on me dakianus and his company withal and they beat me with a grievous beating till i desired death and reproached myself saying 'this is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which allah hath vouchsafed to him beyond his own competence and thou o my soul verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee dost thou not know that pride angereth the lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the fire' then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground every three days they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water and every month or two the knight came to the hermitage now his daughter tamasil had grown up for she was nine years old when i first saw her and fifteen years passed over me in captivity so that she had reached her four and twentieth year there is not in our land nor in the land of the greeks a fairer than she and her father feared lest the king take her from him for she had vowed herself to the messiah and rode with dakianus in the habit of a cavalier so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness no one who saw her knew her for a woman and her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein and i saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities none may keep count of them save almighty allah now ye are worthier of these riches than those infidels so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the moslems and especially on fighters in the holy war when these merchants came to constantinople and sold their merchandise that image which is on the wall spoke to them by grace of a marvel which allah granted to me so they made for that hermitage and slew matruhina after torturing him with most grievous torments and dragging him by the beard till he showed them the place where i was when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death now tomorrow night tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit and her father and his squires will come after her as he feareth for her so if ye would witness these things take me with you and i will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the knight dakianus which be in that mountain for i saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom and i heard a damsel of their company sing to them in arabic and wellaway that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the koran if then ye will enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of dakianus and his daughter and take her for she is fit only for the king of the age sharrkan or king zau almakan thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the wazir dandan who put scant faith in her story for her words took no hold on his reason and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his face yet he was confounded at her discourse but he feared to speak with her for awe of the king then quoth the ancient dame zat aldawahi verily i fear lest the knight come and seeing these troops encamped in the meadow be afraid to enter the hermitage so zau almakan ordered the army to march upon constantinople and said i have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage then he sent at once for the chief chamberlain whom they brought into the presence and he summoned likewise the leaders of the turks and daylamites and said as soon as it is dawn do ye set forth for constantinople and thou o chamberlain shalt take my place in council and contrivance while thou o rustam shalt be my brother's deputy in battle but let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders and he and sharrkan and the minister dandan set out for the hermitage and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasureand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the ninetysixth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan and his brother zau almakan and the wazir dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed zat aldawahi and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure now as soon as dawned the morn the chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure and they set out thinking that the two kings and the wazir were with them knowing not that the three had made for the monastery such was the case with the host but as regards the two kings and the minister they tarried in their place till the end of that day now the infidels who were with zat aldawahi took their departure privily after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march so she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile and when it was dark night she arose and went in to zau almakan and his companions and said to them come let us set out for the mountain and take with you a few men at arms they obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain whilst the rest rode on before zat aldawahi who gained new strength for excess of joy so that zau almakan said glory be to him who sustaineth this holy man whose like we never saw now the witch had written a letter to the king of constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird acquainting him with what had passed and ending i wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution lest the host of alislam get sight of them and when they reach the hermitage let them ambush themselves there till i come to them with the moslem king and his brother for i shall inveigle them and will bring them thither together with the wazir and an hundred horse and no more that i may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage i am resolved to slay the monk matruhina since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life if my plot work well not one of the moslems shall return to his own country no not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight and matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the nazarene faith and the servants of the cross and praise be to the messiah first and last when this letter reached constantinople the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to king afridun who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and after reaching the tower to hide therein thus far concerning them but as regards king zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan and the escort when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the monk matruhina who came out to see who and what they were whereupon quoth that pious man zat aldawahi slay this damned fellow so they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them and after gathering the whole together they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith as for tamasil she came not she or her father for fear of the moslems so zau almakan tarried there awaiting her all that day and the next and a third till sharrkan said to him by allah i am troubled anent the army of alislam for i know not what is become of them his brother replied and i also am concerned for them we have come by this great treasure and i do not believe that tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage after that befel which hath befallen the host of the christians it behoveth us then to content ourselves with what allah hath given us and depart so haply he will help us conquer constantinople accordingly they came down from the mountain while zat aldawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse as soon as these saw the moslems they encircled them from all sides couching lance and baring the white sabre blade and the infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring when zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the minister dandan looked upon this host they saw that it was a numerous army and said who can have given these troops information of us replied sharrkan o my brother this be no time for talk this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts for this strait is like a street with two gates though by the virtue of the lord of arabs and ajams were not the place so narrow i would bring them to naught even though they were an hundred thousand men said zau almakan had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse and the wazir dandan continued if we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows but allah will succour us against them i know this defile and its straitness and i know there be many places of refuge in it for i have been here on razzia with king omar bin alnu'uman what while we besieged constantinople we abode in this place and here is water colder than snow so come let us push out of this defile ere the infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top whence they will hurl down rocks upon us and we powerless to come at them so they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows but the pious man zat aldawahi looked at them and said what is it ye fear ye who have vowed yourselves to the lord and to working his will by allah i abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years yet never gainsaid the almighty in aught he did with me fight ye in allah's way so whoever of you is slain paradise shall be his abode and whoso slayeth his striving shall be to his honour when they heard from the ascetic these words their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the infidels charged down from all sides whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them the moslems fought for the service of allah a right good fight and wrought upon his foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance whilst zau almakan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight five by five and ten by ten till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting now while so doing he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them and all who feared fled to her for shelter but she was also signing the infidels to slay sharrkan so troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die but each troop that charged he charged and drove back and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory and he said in himself verily on this holy men allah looketh with eyes of his favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the infidels with the purity of his pious intent for i see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight so they battled the rest of the day and when night fell the moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone and that day were slain of them five and forty and when they were gathered together they sought the devotee but could find no trace of him and this was grievous to them and they said belike he hath died a martyr quoth sharrkan i saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of holy writ now while they were talking behold the accursed old woman zat aldawahi stood before them hending in hand the head of the chief captain of the ten thousand horse a noble knight a champion fierce in fight and a satan for blight one of the turks had slain him with an arrow and allah hurried his soul to the fire and when the infidels saw what that moslem had done with their leader they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords and allah hurried his soul to heaven then the accursed old woman cut off that knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of sharrkan and zau almakan and the wazir dandan now when sharrkan sew her he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed praised be allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee o holy man and devout champion of the religion replied she o my son i have sought martyrdom this day and have thrown my life away amid the infidel array but they feared me with dismay when ye dispersed i waxed jealous for your honour so i rushed on the chief knight their leader albeit he was a match for a thousand horse and i smote him till i severed head from trunk not one of the infidels could near me so i brought his head to youand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the ninetyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the damned witch zat aldawahi took the head of the knight the leader of the twenty thousand infidels she brought it and threw it down before zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan saying when i saw your condition i waxed jealous for your honour so i rushed on the chief knight and smote him with the sword till i severed head from trunk and none could near me so i brought his head to you that you may be strengthened in holy war and work out with your swords the will of the lord of the faithful and now i purpose leaving you to strive against the infidels whilst i go to your army though they be at the gates of constantinople and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these unfaithfuls quoth sharrkan how wilt thou pass to them o thou holy man seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the miscreants quoth the accursed hag allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight me nor if any saw me would he dare to attack me at that time for i shall be as one non existing absorbed in allah and he will fend off from me his foes thou sayest sooth o holy man rejoined sharrkan for indeed i have been witness of that so if thou can pass out at the first of the night 'twill be best for us replied she i will set out at this very hour and if thou desire thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him but none else for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain sharrkan said as for me i will not leave my comrades but if my brother will there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait for he is the stronghold of the moslems and the sword of the lord of the three worlds and if it be his pleasure let him take with him the wazir dandan or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs so after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the infidels if they be asleep or awake quoth they we will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to allah if i do your bidding replied she blame me not but blame yourselves for it is my rede that you await me till i bring you tidings of the case then said sharrkan go to them and delay not from us for we shall be awaiting thee thereupon she fared forth and sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said were not this holy man a miracle worker he had never slain yonder furious knight this is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power and of a truth the pride of the infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier for he was violent an evil devil and a stubborn now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee behold the accursed zat aldawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the unbelievers wherefor they thanked her not knowing that all this was wile and guile and the damned hag asked where be the king of the age zau almakan and the minister dandan answered he here am i take with thee thy wazir said she and follow after me that we may fare forth to constantinople now she had acquainted the infidels with the cheat she had put upon the moslems and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and said our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their king in return for the knight's death because we had no stouter rider than he and they added bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the moslems when thou bringest him to us we will bear him to king afridun then she went out and went out with her zau almakan and the minister dandan and she walked on before the two saying fare forth with the blessing of almighty allah so they did her bidding for the shaft of pate and fortune of man's lot had shot them and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the grecian camp till they came to the defile the narrow pass aforesaid whilst the infidel enemy watched them but did them no hindrance for the infernal old woman had enjoined this now when zau almakan and the wazir dandan saw that the infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight the wazir exclaimed by allah this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles and doubtless he be of the elect rejoined zau almakan by allah i think the infidels be naught but blind for we see them and they see us not and while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers behold the infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them saying is there anyone else with you twain that we may seize upon him too and the wazir dandan replied see you not yon other man that is before us ' replied the unbelievers by the truth of the messiah and the monks and the primate and the metropolitan we see none save you two then zau almakan said by allah this is a chastisement decreed to us by almighty allahand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the ninetyeighth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the unfaithful had seized upon king zau almakan and the wazir dandan they said to the two is there anyone else with you twain that we may seize upon him also and the wazir dandan replied see you not yon other man who be with us they rejoined by the truth of the messiah and the monks and the primate and the metropolitan we see none save you two then the infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night whilst zat aldawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight so they fell to lamenting and saying to each other verily the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us so far concerning zau almakan and the wazir dandan but as regards king sharrkan he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer he and his men made ready to do battle with the infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good then they sallied out till they were hard upon the unbelievers and when these saw them from afar they cried out to them saying o moslems we have taken captives your sultan and your wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs and except ye leave off fighting us we will slay you to the last man but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our king who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught and we will do you no harm in aught if ye accept it will be well for you but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death so we have told you sooth and this is our last word to you now when sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the wazir dandan he was weighed down with woe and wept his force failed him and making sure of death he said to himself would i knew the cause of their capture did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him or what was the matter then they sprang up to battle with the unbelievers and slew great numbers of them the brave was known that day from craven men and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain for the infidels flocked up on them as flies flock to drink from hill and from plain but sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore and when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place and the moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on allah and the scymitar now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest emirs and they had killed thousands of the infidels footmen and fighters on horse when sharrkan saw this the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades what shall we do whereto all answered that which almighty allah willeth shall befal us on the morning of the second day sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop if ye go forth to fight not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water so i deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern to hinder any from entering haply the holy man may have reached the moslem host and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the infidels for belike the unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him they said this were the better course to take and of its expediency no doubt we make so the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls and every one of the infidels who sought to enter in they slew thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dunand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the ninetyninth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the army of the moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe and every one of the infidels attempted to charge them him they slew and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun by which time king sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left then quoth the infidels to one another when shall these battle days have an end we are weary of warring the moslems and quoth one of them up and at them for there remain of them but five and twenty men if we cannot prevail on them to fight let us light a fire upon them and if they submit themselves and yield to us we will take them prisoners but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire may the messiah on their fathers have no grace and may the sojourn of the nazarenes be for them no abiding place so they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it thereupon sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners and while they were in this condition lo the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter it is not for any save for king afridun to kill them that he may gratify his wrath therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow when we will journey with them to constantinople and deliver them to our king who shall deal with them as he please said they this is the right course and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them then as soon as it was black night the infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs now sharrkan and his brother zau almakan were in confinement and so also were his companion knights whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him o my brother how win free by allah replied zau al makan i know not for here we be like birds in cage then sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself till his pinion bonds brass asunder whereupon being free he arose and went up to the captain of the guard and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters freed zau almakan and the wazir dandan and the rest of his men then he turned to the two and said i desire to slay three of these infidels and take and don their dress we three so that we shall be guised as greeks and we will pass through them with out their knowing us and fare forth to our own force replied zau almakan this is no safe counsel for if we kill them i fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us 'twere the surer way to pass out of the defile so they agreed upon this and set out and when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping and sharrkan said to his brother better we take each one of us a steed there were five and twenty horsemen so they took five and twenty horses whilst allah sent sleep upon the infidels for a purpose he knew and the faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach meanwhile sharrkan set to gathering from the infidels as many weapons swords and spears as were wanted and while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the infidels supposed that anyone could release zau almakan and his brother and their men or that their prisoners had power to escape now when all the captives were safe from the unfaithful sharrkan came up with his comrades and found them awaiting his arrival on coals of flame expecting him in anxious grame so he turned to them and said feel no fear since allah protecteth us i have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose what is it asked they and he answered i desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice 'allaho akbar' and ye add 'the army of al islam is upon you allaho akbar' this wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk but they will think that the moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn replied zau almakan this plan is not good we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word for if we cry out 'allaho akbar' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape rejoined sharrkan by allah though they should awake tis no matter and i long that ye fall in with my plan for naught save good can come of it so they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted allaho akbar and hills and trees and rocks reworded their allaho akbar for fear of the almighty but when the kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one anotherand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the one hundredth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan spake thus i long that ye fall in with this my plan for naught save good can come of it so they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted allaho akbar and hills and trees and rocks re worded their allaho akbar for fear of the almighty the infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said the foe is upon us by the truth of the messiah then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save almighty allah as soon as it was dawn they sought for the captives but found no trace of them and their captains said they who did this were the prisoners in our possession up then and after them in all haste till ye overtake them when we will make them quaff the cup of requital and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you so they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them now when zau almakan saw this he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother what i feared would come is come upon us and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the faith but sharrkan preferred to hold his peace then zau al makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest shouting allaho akbar and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the lord of faithful men and while they were in this case behold they heard many voices voicing there is no god but the god god is most great salutation and salvation upon the apostle the bringer of glad tidings the bearer of bad tidings'' so they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of moslems who believed in one god pushing towards them whereat their hearts were heartened and sharrkan charged upon the infidels crying out there is no god but the god god is most great he and those with him so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the moslems followed them with lunge and blow and zau almakan and his comrades of the moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the infidel foe and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight thereupon the moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations and when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen they saw bahram the captain of the daylamites and rustam the captain of the turks advancing to join them with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim as soon as they saw zau almakan the riders dismounted and saluted him and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of unbelievers then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after resurrection day now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this when the emir bahram and the emir rustam and the chief chamberlain with the moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead came in sight of constantinople they saw that the nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts and had set all their defenders in order of defence as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of alislam and the banners mohammedan and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the moslems with their standards and ensigns of the faith of unity under the dust clouds and lo they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain and the voices of the moslems chanting the koran and glorifying the compassionate one struck their ears now the infidels knew of the approach of this host through zat aldawahi with her craft and whoredom calumny and contrivance and the armies of alislam drew near as it were the swollen sea for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children then quoth the general of the turks to the general of the daylamites o emir of a truth we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows indeed yon infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a sultan in very sooth we run danger from these enemies whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold especially in the absence of king zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the illustrious wazir dandan if they know of this they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man not one of us safety shall see so it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the turks and march them to the hermitage of matruhina and the meadow of malkhin in quest of our brothers and comrades if thou act by my advice it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance in case they be hard pressed by the infidels and if thou act not blame will not attach to me but an ye go it behoveth that ye return quickly for ill suspicion is part of prudence the emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned so much for the cause of their coming but as regards the ancient dame zat aldawahi as soon as she had delivered sultan zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan into the hands of the infidels the foul whore mounted a swift steed saying to the faithless i design to rejoin the moslem army which is at constantinople and contrive for their destruction for i will inform them that their chiefs are dead and when they hear that from me their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered then will i go to king afridun lord of constantinople and to my son hardub king of roum and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive so she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night and when day dawned appeared the armies of bahram and rustam advancing towards her so she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself haply the moslem hosts be returning routed from the assault of constantinople however as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversed and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men but fearing for their king and comrades when she was assured of this she hastened towards them running at speed like a devil of ill rede till reaching them she cried out haste ye haste ye o soldiers of the compassionate one hasten to the holy war against the hosts of satan when bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her o friend of allah what is behind thee answered she question not of sad case and sore condition for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of matruhina and designed to win their way constantinople wards thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the infidels and the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror adding the most of them are dead and there are but five and twenty men left said bahram o holy man when didst thou leave them but this night replied she he cried glory be to allah to him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a midrib of palmtree but thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by his directions then he mounted his horse and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies and he said there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us for our sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him then they cut across the country wide and side night and day and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw zau almakan and sharrkan shouting there is no god but the god allaho akbar and salutation and salvation upon the congratulator the comminator whereupon he and his drove at the unbelievers and whelmed them as the rain torrent whelms the waste and cried out their war cries till fear get hold of the prowess knights and the mountains were cloven in affright and when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant and each recognised other as hath been said before then they kissed the ground before the king and before his brother sharrkan who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave now thereat they marvelled and said to one another hasten we back to constantinople for we left our companions there and our hearts are with them so they hurried departure commending themselves to the subtle the allwise and zau almakan exhorted the moslems to steadfast ness and versified in the following coupletsbe praises mine to all praiseworthy thee  o lord who stinted not mine aid to bethough was i lost abroad thou west to me  strongest support which vouchsafed victorythou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts  and slungest con quering sword of valiancythou mad'st me blest beneath thy kingly shade  engraced with generous boons dealt fain and freethou savedst from every fear i feared by aid  of my wazir the age's noblest hegarred us thy grace in fight to throw the greek  who yet came back dight in war's cramoisiethen made i feint to fly from out the fight  but like grim lion turning made them fleeand left on valley sole my foemen drunk  not with old wine but deathcup's revelrythen came the saintly hermit and he showed  his marvels wrought for town and wold to seewhen slew they herowights who woke to dwell  in eden bowers wherein sweet rilllets wellbut when zau almakan had made an end of versifying his brother sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their armyand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the one hundred and first nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan congratulated his brother zau almakan on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army such was their case but as regards the old woman zat aldawahi after she had foregathered with the hosts of rustam and bahram she returned to the coppice where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed till she drew near the moslem army that beleaguered constantinople when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the chief chamberlain and when he saw her he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said welcome o pious recluse then he questioned her of what had befallen and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies saying in sooth i fear for the emir rustam and the emir bahram for that i met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the king and his companions now there are but twenty thousand horse and the unbelievers outnumber them so i would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour lest they be slain to the last man and she cried to them haste haste when the chamberlain and the moslems heard these words their spirits fell and they wept but zat aldawahi said to them ask aidance of allah and bear patiently this triburation for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of mohammed and paradise with its palaces is laid out by allah for those who die martyrs and needs must all die but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the faith the chamberlain hearing this speech of the accursed old woman called for the emir bahram's brother a knight by name tarkash and choosing out for him ten thousand horse riders famed for force bade him set out at once so he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night till he neared the moslems when daylight dawned sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of alislam and said if these troops which are coming upon us be moslem men our victory is assured by them but if these be nazarenes there is no gainsaying destiny's decrees then he turned to his brother zau al makan and said never fear for with my life i will ransom thee from death if these be mohammedan troops then were it an increase of heavenly favours but if they be our foes there is no help save that we fight them yet do i long to meet the holy man ere i die so i may beg him to pray that i die not save by death of martyrdom whilst the twain were thus speaking behold there appeared the banners inscribed with the words there is no god but the god and mohammed is the apostle of god and sharrkan cried out how is it with the moslems all are sound and safe replied they and we came not but out of concern for you then the chief of the army dismounted and kissing ground before sharrkan asked o my lord how be the sultan and the wazir dandan and rustam and my brother bahram are they all in safety he answered all well but who brought thee tidings of us quoth tarkash it was the holy man who told us that he had met my brother bahram and rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you but i see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious they questioned him and how did the holy man reach you and he replied walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night ten days' journey for a well girt horseman there is no doubt but that he is a saint of allah said sharrkan but where is he now they rejoined we left him with our troops the folk of the faith moving them to do battle with the rebels and the faithless thereat sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the holy man and commended the dead to his mercy saying this was writ in the book then they set out making for constantinople by forced marches and whilst they were on this enterprise behold a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons the eastern and the western from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night but sharrkan looked at it and said verily i fear lest this be the infidels who have routed the army of alislam for that this dust walleth the world east and west and hideth the two horizons north and south presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness blacker than the blackness of dismal days nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the day of doom horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case when behold they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out o people of the best of mankind the lamp which shineth in darkness blind verily the infidels have outwitted the moslems by guile for they fell upon the host of the one god whilst they deemed themselves safe from the faithless and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile so hasten to the aid of the believers in the unity of god and deliver them from those who deny him now when sharrkan heard these words his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble and alighting from his steed in amazement he kissed the recluse's hands and feet on like wise did his brother zau almakan and the rest of the foot and horse troops except the wazir dandan who dismounted not but said by allah my heart flieth from this devotee for i never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane so leave him and rejoin your comrades the moslems for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the lord of the three worlds how often have i here made razzias with king omar bin alnu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands said sharrkan put away from thee such evil thought hast thou not seen this holy man exciting the faithful to fight and holding spears and swords light so slander him not for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the pious look how he inciteth us to fight the foe and did not almighty allah love him he had cast him aforetime into fearful torment then sharrkan bade bring a nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said mount o pious man devout and virtuous but the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial that he might attain his end and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saithhe prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy  when once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good byeso the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen like a wily fox meditating guile and began to uplift her voice chanting the koran and praising the compassionate one and they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of alislam where sharrkan found the moslem in conquered plight and the chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight whilst the sword of greece havoc dight among the faithful the righteous and those who work uprightand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the one hundred and second nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sharrkan saw the moslems in conquered plight and the chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright the cause of this weakness among the moslems was that the accursed old woman zat al dawahi the foe of the faith after seeing that bahram and rustam had set forward with their troops to join sharrkan and his brother zau almakan repaired to the camp of the mahometans before constantinople and caused the mission of the emir tarkash as hath been before said in this her purpose was to divide the moslem forces the better to weaken them then she left them and entered constantinople and called with a loud voice on the knights of the greeks saying let me down a cord that i may tie thereto this letter and do ye bear it to your king afridun that he may read it and to my son king hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding so they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following from the terriblest of tribulations and the chiefest of all calamities zat aldawahi to king afridun greeting but afterwards of a truth i have contrived a device for destroying the moslems so bide ye quiet and content i have cozened and captured their sultan and the wazir dandan and then i returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung and i have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the emir tarkash to succour the capitves of whom there be now left but few it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man for verily the messiah looketh down upon you and the blessed virgin favoureth you and i hope of the messiah that he forget not what deed i have done when her letter came to king afridun he rejoiced with great joyance and sending at once for king hardub of greece son of zat aldawahi read the letter to him as soon as he camewhereathe was exceeding glad and said see my mother's craft verily it dispenseth with swords and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the day of dread rejoined afridun may the messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile then he bade the knights give orders for sallying outside the city and the news was noised abroad in constantinople so the nazarenes and the cohorts of the cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies and blaspheming the lord of all creatures when the chamberlain saw the sally he said behold the greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our sultan is far away and haply they have attacked us for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of king zau almakan therewith he waxed wroth and cried out ho soldiers of alislam and favourers of the true faith an you flee you are lost but if ye stand fast ye win know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the almighty is able to make it straight allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain thereupon the moslems cried out allaho akbar and the believer in the one god shouted his slogan and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore the priests and monks priested it tight girding their girdles and uplifting the crucifixes while the moslem shouted out the professions of the requiting king and verses of the koran began to sing the hosts of the compassion are one fought against the legions of satan and head flew from body of man while the good angels hovered above the people of the chosen prophet nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened now the miscreants had encompassed the moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them and the faithless greeded for victory over the faithful until day dawned and dazzled there upon the chamberlain mounted he and his men trusting thee allah would help them to victory and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post and heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead the craven turned tail and fled and the judge of death judged and sentence sped so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain then the moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent and the greek took possession of some of their tents whereupon the moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight when meanwhile behold up came sharrkan with the rest of the host of alislam and the standards of the believers in unity and having come up with them he charged the infidels and followed him zau almakan and the wazir dandan and the emirs bahram and rustam with his brother tarkash when the foe saw this they lost head and their reason fled and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous believers joined their pious comrades then sharrkan accosted the chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness and he in turn gave the prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day thereat the moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to allah in their fight for the faith but when the idolaters beheld the standards mohammedan and there on the profession of faith islamitan proclaiming the unity they shrieked woe and ruin and besought succour of the patriarchs of the monasteries then fell they to calling upon john and mary and the cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter whilst king afridun went up to consult king hardub of greece for the two kings stood one at the head of each wing right and left now there was with them also a famous cavalier lawiya highs who commanded the centre and they drew out in battle array but indeed they were full of alarm and affray meanwhile the moslems aligned their forces and thereupon sharrkan came to his brother zau almakan and said o king of the age doubtless they mean to champion it and that is also the object of our desire but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters for by forethought is one half of life wrought replied the sultan as thou wilt o companion of good counsel it is my wish added sharrkan to stand in mid line opposite the infidel with the wazir dandan on my left and thee on my right whilst the emir bahram leads the dexter wing and the emir rustam leads the wing sinistral and thou o mighty king shalt be under the standards and the ensigns for that thou art the pillar of our defence upon thee after allah is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee zau almakan thanked him therefor and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn but as things stood thus behold there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of roum and as he drew near they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule fleeing with her master from the shock of swords her housings were of white silk covered by a prayercarpet of cash mere stuff and on her back sat a shaykh an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect garbed in a gown of white wool he stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the moslem and said i am an ambassador to you all and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver so give me safe conduct and permit of speech that i communicate to you my message replied sharrkan thou art in safety fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance thereupon the old man dismounted and taking the cross from his neck placed it before the sultan and humbled himself with much humility then quoth to him the moslems what is with thee of news and quoth he i am an ambassador from king afridun for i counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the compassionate one and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular so he agreed to that and he saith to you 'verily i will ransom my army with my life so let the moslem king do as i do and with his life ransom his host and if he kill me there will be no stay left in the army of roum and if i kill him there will be no stability with the moslems when sharrkan heard this he said o monk i agree to that for it is just nor may it be gainsaid and behold i will meet him in duello and do with him derring do for i am champion of the faithful even as he is champion of the faithless and if he slay me he will have won the day and naught will remain for the moslems forces save flight so return to him o thou monk and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye so the monk returned and he rejoicing to king afridun and king hardub and told them both what sharrkan had said whereat king afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness and he said to himself no doubt but this sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance and when i shall have slain him their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered now zat aldawahi had written to king afridun of that and had told him how sharrkan was a knight of the braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him but afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow so when he heard the report of the monk that sharrkan agreed to the duello he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him the infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing and as soon as it was dawn the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade and behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain mounted on a steed of purest strain and for foray and fray full ready and fain and that knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight on his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of khalanj wood the curious work of the frank weighing a quintal then the rider uncovered his face and cried out saying whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me and whoso knoweth me not right soon shall ken who i be i am afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened shawhi zat aldawahi but he had not ended speaking ere sharrkan the champion of the moslems fared forth to meet him mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore he crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne and he cried out to afridun woe to thee o accursed dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing they advanced and retreated and drew together and withdrew and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play and strife and stay with stroke of sword and lunge of lance of the two armies looking on some said sharrkan is victor and others afridun will conquer and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan then cried out king afridun to sharrkan saying by the truth of the messiah and the faith which is no liar thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble i ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a prince for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slave and see they bring thee out a charger which is not thine that thou mayst mount and return to the fight but by the truth of my faith thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and i am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse till thou approve to the cavaliers thy generous blood and skill in brunt when sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave he waxt wroth and turned towards his men meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse when lo afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at sharrkan now when the moslem turned his back he found none of the men near him and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed infidel so he wheeled round in haste and behold the javelin came at him so he swerved from it till his head was bent low as his saddle bow the weapon grazed his breast and pierced the skin of his chest for sharrkan was high bosomed whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away thereat the accursed afridun was joyful thinking he had slain him and shouted to the infidels bidding them rejoice whereat the faithless were encouraged and the faithful wept when zau almakan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him thereupon the infidels drove at the moslems the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled whilst the keen scymitar of alyaman did good work now the first to reach sharrkan was the wazir dandanand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the one hundred and third nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king zau almakan saw that the accursed infidel had struck with javelin his brother sharrkan he deemed him dead and despatched cavaliers towards him and the first to reach him were the wazir dandan and the emir of the turks bahram and the emir of the daylamites rustam they found him falling from his horse so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother zau almakan then they gave him in charge to his pages and went again to do the work of cut and thrust so the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay so they called a truce and each army returned to its tents whilst all the infidels repaired to king afridun and kissed the ground before him and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over sharrkan then the king fared for constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm when king hardub came to him and said may the messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother zat aldawahi shall pray for thee know that the moslems can make no stay without sharrkan replied afridun to morrow shall end the affair when to fight i fare i will seek zau almakan and slay him and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail such was the case with the kafirs but as regards the host of alislam when zau almakan returned to his tent he thought of naught but his brother and going into the pavilion found him in evil case and sore condition whereupon he summoned for counsel the wazir dandan and rustam and bahram when they entered they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine sharrkan and they wept and said the world will not readily afford his like and they watched by him all that night and about the later hours came to them the recluse in tears when zau almakan saw him he rose in honour and the religious stroked sharrkan's wound with his hand chanting somewhat of the koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the compassionate one and the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn when he came to himself and opening his eyes moved his tongue in his mouth and spake at this zau almakan rejoiced saying of a truth the blessing of the holy man hath taken effect on him and sharrkan said praised be allah for recovery indeed i am well at this hour that accursed one played me false and but that i swerved aside lighter than lightening the throw spear had pierced through my breast so praised be allah for saving me and how is it with the moslems answered zau almakan all are weeping for thee quoth sharrkan i am well and in good case but where is the holy man now he was sitting by him and said at thy head so the prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said o my son be of good patience and allah shall increase thy reward for the wage is measured by the work sharrkan rejoined pray for me and he prayed for him as soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen the moslems sallied out to the plain and the kafirs made ready to thrust and cut then the islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight and king zau almakan and afridun made to charge one at other but when zau almakan fared forth into the field there came with him the wazir dandan and the chamberlain and bahram saying we will be thy sacrifice he replied by the holy house and zemzem and the place i will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses and when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out where is afridun that i may make him taste the cup of disgrace but when king hardub saw the case he conjured afridun not to attack him saying o king yesterday it was thy turn to fight it is mine to day i care naught for his prowess so he rushed out towards zau almakan brand in hand and under him a stallion like abjar which was antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poeton the glancing racer outracing glance  he speeds as though he would collar doomhis steed's black coat is of darkest jet  and likest night in her nightliest gloomwhose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears  like thunders rolling in thun d'rous boomif he race the wind he will lead the way  and the lightning flash will behind him loom''then each rushed upon the opponent parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event at last zau almakan cried out his war cry and rushed upon hardub king of csarea and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot when the infidels saw this they charged in a body compact and united upon zau almakan who met them amidfield and they engaged in hewing and foining till blood ran in rills then the moslems cried out allaho akbar god is most great and there is no god but the god and invoked salvation for the prophet the bringer of glad tidings the bearer of bad tidings and there befel a great fight but allah assigned victory to the faithful and defeat to the faithless the wazir dandan shouted take your blood revenge for king omar bin al nu'uman and his son sharrkan and bared his head and cried out to the turks now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse and all charged with him as men when the faithless found naught to save their lives but flight so they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number much folk also were slain while going in at the gates for the flock was great then the greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault and in fine the moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory and king zau almakan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case so he made a prostration of thanks to the bountiful and the exalted and then he came forward and gave sharrkan joy of his recovery answered he verily we are all under the benediction of this religious holy and righteous nor would you have been victorious but for his accepted orisons indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the moslemsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the one hundred and fourth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when zau al makan went in to his brother sharrkan he found him sitting with the holy man by his side so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery answered he verily we are all under the benediction of this recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the moslems i found strength return to me when i heard your 'allaho akbar' for then i knew you to be victorious over your enemies but now recount to me o my brother what befel thee so he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of allah and sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess when zat aldawahi heard tell of her son's death and she still drest as a devotee her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears she kept her counsel however and feigned to the moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy but she said to herself by the truth of the messiah there remaineth no profit of my life if i burn not his heart for his brother sharrkan even as he hath burned my heart for king hardub the mainstay of christendom and the hosts of crossdom still she kept her secret and the wazir dandan and king zau almakan and the chamberlain remained sitting with sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves saying to morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege then said sharrkan to them ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up they accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion and none remained with sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman zat aldawahi he talked with her through part of the night then he stretched himself to rest and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead such was the case with sharrkan and his men but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and looking at sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep thereupon she sprang to her feet as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body and once more she sprang to her feet and going the round of the sleeping servants she cut off their heads also lest they should awake then she left the tent and made for the sultan's pavilion but finding the guards on the alert turned to that of the wazir dandan now she found him reading the koran and when his sight fell upon her he said welcome to the holy man hearing this from the wazir her heart trembled and she said the reason of my coming hither at this time is that i heard the voice of a saint amongst allah's saints and am going to him then she turned her back but the wazir said to himself by allah i will follow our devotee this night so he rose and walked after her but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps she knew that he was following her wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself unless i serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me so she turned and said to him from afar ho thou wazir i am going in search of this saint that i may learn who he is and after learning this much i will ask his leave for thee to visit him then i will come back and tell thee for i fear thine accompanying me without having his permission lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society now when the wazir heard these words he was ashamed to answer her so he left her and returned to his tent and would have slept but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself i will go to sharrkan and chat with him till morning but when he entered into sharrkan's pavilion he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food at this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep the folk hastened to him and seeing the blood streaming set up a clamour of weeping and wailing then the noise awoke the sultan who enquired what was the matter and it was said to him sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered so he rose in haste and entered the tent and found the wazir dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him weeping and crying out and so remained for a while till he came to himself when he looked at sharrkan and wept with sore weeping while the wazir and rustam and bahram did the like but the chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself such was his alarm then said zau almakan know ye who did this deed and how is it i see not the devotee him who the things of this world hath put away quoth the wazir and who should have been the cause of this affliction save that devotee that satan by allah my heart abhorred him from the first because i know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous and he repeated to the king the tale of how he would have followed the religious but he forbade him whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before him who is ever near him who ever answereth prayer supplicating that he would cause the false devotee who denied allah's testimony to fall into their hands then they laid sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his farfamed virtuesand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the one hundred and fifth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that they laid sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his farfamed virtues then they looked for the opening of the city gate but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder but king zau almakan said by allah i will not turn back from them though i sit here for years and years till i take blood revenge for my brother sharrkan and waste constantinople and kill the king of the nazarenes even if death overcome me and i be at rest from this woeful world then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the monastery of matruhina and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him moreover he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them do ye send supplies to your households for i am resolved to abide by this city year after year till i have taken man bote for my brother sharrkan even if i die in this stead and when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied to hear is to obey thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same together with the monies to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied and acquaint them saying we are encamped before constantinople and we will either destroy it or die and albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years we will not depart hence till we take it moreover he bade the wazir dandan write to his sister nuzhat alzaman and said to him acquaint her with what hath befallen us and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that when i went out to war my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed and if she hath given birth to a boy as i have heard say hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news then he gave them somewhat of money which they pouched and set out at once and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages after they had departed zau almakan turned to the wazir dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls so the troops pushed forward but found none on the ramparts whereat they marvelled while zau almakan was troubled at the case for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the ascetic in this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone so far concerning the moslems but as regards the greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this as soon as zat aldawahi had slain sharrkan she hastened her march and reached the walls of constantinople where she called out in the greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope quoth they who art thou and quoth she i am zat al dawahi they knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up and when inside the city she went in to the king afridun and said to him what is this i hear from the moslems they say that my son king hardub is slain he answered yes and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made afridun and all who were present weep with her then she told the king how she had slain sharrkan and thirty of his servants whereat he rejoiced and thanked her and kissing her hands exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son said she by the truth of the messiah i will not rest content with killing that dog of the moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son a king of the kings of the age now there is no help for it but that i work some guile and i contrive a wile whereby to slay the sultan zau almakan and the wazir dandan and the chamberlain and rustam and bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of alislam for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of sharrkan's head no never then said she to king afridun know o king of the age that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my girdle and to break the crosses replied afridun do what thou desire i will not gainsay thee in aught and if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing for though the moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness then the accursed one when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought took ink case and paper and wrote thereon from shawahi zat al dawahi to the host of the moslems know ye that i entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand i slew your king omar bin alnu'uman in the midst of his palace moreover i slew in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave many of your men and the last i killed were sharrkan and his servants and if fortune do not stay me and satan obey me i needs must slay me your sultan and the wazir dandan for i am she who came to you in disguise of a recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits wherefore an you would be in safety after this fare ye forth at once and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce and though ye tarry here years and years ye shall not do your desire on us and so peace be yours after writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for king hardub arid on the fourth she called a knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the moslem camp when this was done she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son saying to him who took the kingship after him nothing will serve me but i must kill zau almakan and all the nobles of alislam such was the case with her but as regards what occurred to the moslems all passed three days in trouble and anxiety and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound so they waited till he had shot it among them and the sultan bade the wazir dandan take the missive and read it he perused it accordingly and when zau almakan heard it to end and understood its purport his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy and the minister dandan said by allah my heart shrank from her quoth the sultan how could this whore play her tricks upon us twice but by the almighty i will not depart hence till i fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of constantinople and he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping but when zat aldawahi arrived amongst the infidels and related to them her adventures at length they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of sharrkan there upon the moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the sultan promised his men that if it should be taken he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts but he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick growing thin as a tooth pick presently the wazir dandan came in to him and said be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come and there is no profit in this mourning how well saith the poetwhatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass  what is to be without a failure shall becomesoon the becoming fortune shall be found to be  and folly's brother shall abide forlorn and glumwherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms he replied o wazir my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home and my mind is concerned for my subjects thereupon the wazir and the bystanders wept but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of constantinople for a length of days and they being thus behold news arrived from baghdad by one of the emirs to the effect that the king's wife had been blessed with a boy and that his sister nuzhat alzaman had named him knmkn moreover that the boy bid fair to be famous already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens and that she had commanded the olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise furthermore that the twain were well that the land had enjoyed abundant rains and that his comrade the fireman was established in all prosperity with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him and she ended with the greeting of peace then quoth zau al makan to the wazir dandan now is my back strengthened for that i have been blest with a son whose name is kanmakanand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the one hundred and sixth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child zau al makan rejoiced with great joy and cried now is my back strengthened for that i have been blessed with a son whose name is kanmakan and he spake to the wazir dandan saying i am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account quoth the wazir thy design is good thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the koran and some began reciting the holy volume whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of allah and thus they did till the morning then zau almakan went up to the grave of his brother sharrkan and poured forth copious tears and improvised these coupletsthey bore him bier'd and all who followed wept  with moses' shrieks what day o'erhead shook tortill reached the grave which pate had made his home  dug in men's souls who one sole god adorene'er had i thought before to see my joy  borne on the bier which heads of bearers boreah no nor ere they homed thee in the dust  that stars of heaven earth ever covered o'eris the tomb dweller hostage of a stead  where light and splendour o'er thy face shall pourpraise to restore his life her word hath pledged  cribbed and confined he shall dispread the morewhen zau almakan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe and the wazir repeated the words of the poetpain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won  thou didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath doneleftest this worldly house without reproach or blame  ah may th' ex change secure thee every benisonthou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence  for us to baffle shafts and whistling spears to shuni see this world is only cheat and vanity  where man naught else must seek but please the truthful oneth' empyrean's lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss  and wi' thy faithful friends the guide show goodly wonei bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief  seeing the west in woe for lack of easting sunwhen the wazir dandan had finished his reciting he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls then came forward one who had been of sharrkan's boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities reciting the following pentastichswhere gone is bounty since thy hand is turned to clay  and i in misery lie since thou west ta'en awaysee'st not o litter guide heaven keep thee glad and gay  how tears adorn my cheeks these furrowed wrinkles fray a sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with dismayby allah ne'er this heart within i spoke of thee  ah no nor dared my sight to see thy brilliancysave that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree  yea and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me may yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to seeand when the man stinted reciting zau almakan and the minister dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears after which all retired to their tents and the king turning to the wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign on this wise the two passed days and nights while zau almakan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said i long to hear stories and adventures of kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love haply allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety and stint and stay my weeping and wailing quoth the wazir if naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore and so forth this thing were easy for i had no other business in the lifetime of thy father who hath found mercy than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him this very night i will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved so shall thy breast be broadened when zau almakan heard these words from the minister his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night that he might hear what the wazir dandan had to tell of the kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before and hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear and what not and when all was in presence he summoned the wazir dandan and the emirs rustam and bahram and tarkash and the grand chamberlain then waited till the whole party was seated before him whereupon he turned to the minister and said know o wazir that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us replied the wazir with joy and good willand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the one hundred and seventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king zau almakan summoned the wazir and the chamberlain and rustam and bahram he turned towards the minister dandan and said know o wazir that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us replied the wazir with love and gladness know o auspicious king that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and

maundrell letter of  tor is mount sinai in the koran xcv  i have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called it is evident that jebel serbal dates only from the early days of coptic christianity that jebel musa its greek rival rose after the visions of helena in the fourth century whilst the building of the convent by justinian belongs to ad  ras safsfah its rival to the north is an affair of yesterday and may be called the invention of robinson and jebel katerina to the south is the property of rppell midian revisited i  i would therefore call the sinaitic peninsula peninsula of paran in old days and peninsula of tor from its chief port in our time it is still my conviction that the true mount sinai will be found in jabal arif or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern hajj road from suez to akabah even about the name which the koran writes sain and snn there is a dispute it is usually derived from the root sanahsentis a bush but this is not satisfactory our eminent assyriologist professor sayce would connect it with sin the assyrian moon god as mount nebo with the sungod and he expects to find there the ruins of a lunar temple as a solar

Chapter 15,Jules Verne,chapter  lyricsin which the bag of banknotes disgorges some thousands of pounds morethe train entered the station and passepartout jumping out first was followed by mr fogg who assisted his fair companion to descend phileas fogg intended to proceed at once to the hong kong steamer in order to get aouda comfortably settled for the voyage he was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous groundjust as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him and said mr phileas foggi am heis this man your servant added the policeman pointing to passepartoutyesbe so good both of you as to follow memr fogg betrayed no surprise whatever the policeman was a representative of the law and law is sacred to an englishman passepartout tried to reason about the matter but the policeman tapped him with his stick and mr fogg made him a signal to obeymay this young lady go with us asked heshe may replied the policemanmr fogg aouda and passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri a sort of fourwheeled carriage drawn by two horses in which they took their places and were driven away no one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination they first passed through the black town with its narrow streets its miserable dirty huts and squalid population then through the european town which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions shaded by coconuttrees and bristling with masts where although it was early morning elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forththe carriage stopped before a modestlooking house which however did not have the appearance of a private mansion the policeman having requested his prisonersfor so truly they might be calledto descend conducted them into a room with barred windows and said you will appear before judge obadiah at halfpast eighthe then retired and closed the doorwhy we are prisoners exclaimed passepartout falling into a chairaouda with an emotion she tried to conceal said to mr fogg sir you must leave me to my fate it is on my account that you receive this treatment it is for having saved mephileas fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible it was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee the complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge there was some mistake moreover he would not in any event abandon aouda but would escort her to hong kongbut the steamer leaves at noon observed passepartout nervouslywe shall be on board by noon replied his master placidlyit was said so positively that passepartout could not help muttering to himself parbleu that's certain before noon we shall be on board but he was by no means reassuredat halfpast eight the door opened the policeman appeared and requesting them to follow him led the way to an adjoining hall it was evidently a courtroom and a crowd of europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartmentmr fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk immediately after judge obadiah a fat round man followed by the clerk entered he proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail and put it hurriedly on his headthe first case said he then putting his hand to his head he exclaimed heh this is not my wigno your worship returned the clerk it is minemy dear mr oysterpuff how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk's wigthe wigs were exchangedpassepartout was getting nervous for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapiditythe first case repeated judge obadiahphileas fogg demanded oysterpuffi am here replied mr foggpassepartoutpresent responded passepartoutgood said the judge you have been looked for prisoners for two days on the trains from bombaybut of what are we accused asked passepartout impatientlyyou are about to be informedi am an english subject sir said mr fogg and i have the righthave you been illtreatednot at allvery well let the complainants come ina door was swung open by order of the judge and three indian priests enteredthat's it muttered passepartout these are the rogues who were going to burn our young ladythe priests took their places in front of the judge and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against phileas fogg and his servant who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the brahmin religionyou hear the charge asked the judgeyes sir replied mr fogg consulting his watch and i admit ityou admit iti admit it and i wish to hear these priests admit in their turn what they were going to do at the pagoda of pillajithe priests looked at each other they did not seem to understand what was saidyes cried passepartout warmly at the pagoda of pillaji where they were on the point of burning their victimthe judge stared with astonishment and the priests were stupefiedwhat victim said judge obadiah burn whom in bombay itselfbombay cried passepartoutcertainly we are not talking of the pagoda of pillaji but of the pagoda of malabar hill at bombayand as a proof added the clerk here are the desecrator's very shoes which he left behind himwhereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his deskmy shoes cried passepartout in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape himthe confusion of master and man who had quite forgotten the affair at bombay for which they were now detained at calcutta may be imaginedfix the detective had foreseen the advantage which passepartout's escapade gave him and delaying his departure for twelve hours had consulted the priests of malabar hill knowing that the english authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour he promised them a goodly sum in damages and sent them forward to calcutta by the next train owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow fix and the priests reached the indian capital before mr fogg and his servant the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive fix's disappointment when he learned that phileas fogg had not made his appearance in calcutta may be imagined he made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces for twentyfour hours fix watched the station with feverish anxiety at last he was rewarded by seeing mr fogg and passepartout arrive accompanied by a young woman whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain he hastened for a policeman and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before judge obadiahhad passepartout been a little less preoccupied he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the courtroom watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood for the warrant had failed to reach him at calcutta as it had done at bombay and suezjudge obadiah had unfortunately caught passepartout's rash exclamation which the poor fellow would have given the world to recallthe facts are admitted asked the judgeadmitted replied mr fogg coldlyinasmuch resumed the judge as the english law protects equally and sternly the religions of the indian people and as the man passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of malabar hill at bombay on the th of october i condemn the said passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred poundsthree hundred pounds cried passepartout startled at the largeness of the sumsilence shouted the constableand inasmuch continued the judge as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant i condemn phileas fogg to a week's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty poundsfix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction if phileas fogg could be detained in calcutta a week it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive passepartout was stupefied this sentence ruined his master a wager of twenty thousand pounds lost because he like a precious fool had gone into that abominable pagodaphileas fogg as selfcomposed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced just as the clerk was calling the next case he rose and said i offer bailyou have that right returned the judgefix's blood ran cold but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand poundsi will pay it at once said mr fogg taking a roll of bankbills from the carpetbag which passepartout had by him and placing them on the clerk's deskthis sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison said the judge meanwhile you are liberated on bailcome said phileas fogg to his servantbut let them at least give me back my

The Shaggy Dog Stories - Chap. 9,George Plant,the shaggy dog stories  chap  lyricsmost some very little of what follows is a true storychapter the secret life of george washington vanderbiltback in  there was a young man who worked as a conductor for the new york central  hudson river railroad this fellow's name was george washington vanderbilt son of william henry vanderbilt president of that railroad and grandson of cornelius vanderbilt founder of this same railroad george was an independent sort and not one to play on his family name so hed taken the name henry van der sloot hank as he liked to be called got the job as a conductor on his own merits and worked in happy anonymitygeorge washington vanderbiltwilliam henry vanderbiltcornelius vanderbiltnow hank carried a bit of a grudge against his father who as you could imagine was a foosty old gent who was never quite satisfied with his son after a year or so on the job hank began to see a way that he could skim a little of the take and this pleased him to no end seeing as how hed be cheating his own father in those days they were still taking fares right there on the train if you didn't already have a ticket when the conductor came by those who had a ticket would give them to the conductor but those that didnt simply paid cash hanks scheme was to simply keep some of that cash as he went through the cars he was circumspect at first and didn't keep every fare only a couple here and there as time went on he developed a keen sense of how much to take but not attract attention he began to amass a sizeable supplement to his regular week salary enough by double in facthank had also taken a bit of a fancy to a certain young lady named philomena hasselwaite who lived in a tidy little ivycovered brick cottage in elmont theyd exchanged polite greetings on the street and in stores for several months and hank finally worked up the nerve to ask her out hed purchased a new carriage and a fine horse with some of his illgotten money and one sunny sunday noon he drove to her house when she answered the door hank asked miss hasselwaite id be asking are you free this saturday nightmiss hasselwaite thought about it for a moment as she eyed the horse and fancy rig at the street after a moment she finally allowed that while she couldn't say for certain quite so early in the week it seemed likely she could keep friday night free for him so the date was made and hank went to work all that week with a bit of a bounce in his step a smile on his face and a heavy pocket from skimming some extra change to ensure he could bankroll their big nightsaturday night finally came round and hank picked up miss hasselwaite in his shiny new carriage they went to dinner at a local hotel the food was just acceptable but neither hank nor philomena were too particular about food and the tables had linen tablecloths new china and candles stuck in winebottles wrapped with twine and it was actually quite romantic after dinner they drove to the theater and saw a good vaudeville lineup including singers dancers comedians and a ventriloquist after the show they walked across the street to the local pharmacy and had an ice cream soda just one with two straws they could share most picturesquehank drove miss hasselwaite home and walked her to her door they stood on the porch a few minutes and talked about the lovely night theyd shared as they talked hank pondered whether he ought to give her a little kiss on the cheek finally he worked up the courage to do just that and as he leaned in she turned her head to kiss him full on the mouththat moment lifted him off the ground in rapture they said good night and he practically floated back to his carriage unfortunately for hank he was so distracted on his way home by the lovelights dancing in his eyes that he struck and killed a pedestrian in the street he was arrested by the constable and released later that night on his own recognizanceat the trial everything seemed to unravel for hank as wonderful as that one night of romance had been this trial was the antithesis first it was revealed that the pedestrian hank killed that night was actually another suitor to miss hasselwaite then it turned out that the prosecutor a lively connecticut yankee was a man so avidly pursuing his career goal to become governor of new york that he managed to paint hank as a malevolent montresortype out to rid the world of his romantic rivals the jury was convinced that hank had run down his victim in cold blood poor hank was found guilty and sentenced to deathcapital punishment in the state of new york at that time was just converting to electrocution so instead of the old fashionedbutsure gallows hank was led to old sparky and given the spongeandwire treatment and a colandertype contraption fixed on his noggin just before they covered his head with a black sack cloth the warden asked hank if it had any last wordshank thought about that for a moment because he wanted to go out with something memorable but nothing came to him finally he stammered i regret that i have one life to give for love he was satisfied it seemed weighty enough and it did fit his feelingswith that they covered his head stepped back and threw the switch nothing happened though so they threw the switch several more times still nothing hank was finea flurry of activity ensued with prison guards and electricians and several of the assembled audience buzzing about like bees finally settled and satisfied the chair was working and there was current to the chair they took a step back to tried againmay i have a second go at some last words asked hank hopefully he'd managed to come up with a really good one about the situation while they were all fussing in this he was denied and they threw the switch nothing happened the electricity was running and the chair was fine unfortunately so was hankonce more the flurry of activity took place unable to find the problem they calledin the prisons head electrician to take a look it took him almost an hour to arrive because he'd been home having supper he was quite cross about being interrupted it was his spaghetti night his favorite dish he finally arrived and inspected everything which consumed another half hour he certified that the chair was working just fine but in order to make his contribution seem worthwhile he unplugged it and then plugged it back in before they threw the switch just as before absolutely nothing happened the electricity was running fine the chair was operating perfectly but hank remained perfectly unharmedhank asked that the sack cloth be removed and a guard compliedive been trying to tell you for some time now that i know what your problem isand what exactly is that asked the head electriciani wanted to say earlier that i've always been too good a conductor for this

Chapter 12: Govinda,Hermann Hesse,chapter  govinda lyricsgovindatogether with other monks govinda used to spend the time of rest between pilgrimages in the pleasuregrove which the courtesan kamala had given to the followers of gotama for a gift he heard talk of an old ferryman who lived one day's journey away by the river and who was regarded as a wise man by many when govinda went back on his way he chose the path to the ferry eager to see the ferryman because though he had lived his entire life by the rules though he was also looked upon with veneration by the younger monks on account of his age and his modesty the restlessness and the searching still had not perished from his hearthe came to the river and asked the old man to ferry him over and when they got off the boat on the other side he said to the old man you're very good to us monks and pilgrims you have already ferried many of us across the river aren't you too ferryman a searcher for the right pathquoth siddhartha smiling from his old eyes do you call yourself a searcher oh venerable one though you are already of an old in years and are wearing the robe of gotama's monksit's true i'm old spoke govinda but i haven't stopped searching never i'll stop searching this seems to be my destiny you too so it seems to me have been searching would you like to tell me something oh honourable onequoth siddhartha what should i possibly have to tell you oh venerable one perhaps that you're searching far too much  in all that searching you don't find the time for findinghow come asked govindawhen someone is searching said siddhartha then it might easily happen that the only thing his eyes still see is that what he searches for that he is unable to find anything to let anything enter his mind because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search because he has a goal because he is obsessed by the goal searching means having a goal but finding means being free being open having no goal you oh venerable one are perhaps indeed a searcher because striving for your goal there are many things you don't see which are directly in front of your eyesi don't quite understand yet asked govinda what do you mean by thisquoth siddhartha a long time ago oh venerable one many years ago you've once before been at this river and have found a sleeping man by the river and have sat down with him to guard his sleep but oh govinda you did not recognise the sleeping manastonished as if he had been the object of a magic spell the monk looked into the ferryman's eyesare you siddhartha he asked with a timid voice i wouldn't have recognised you this time as well from my heart i'm greeting you siddhartha from my heart i'm happy to see you once again you've changed a lot my friendand so you've now become a ferrymanin a friendly manner siddhartha laughed a ferryman yes many people govinda have to change a lot have to wear many a robe i am one of those my dear be welcome govinda and spend the night in my hutgovinda stayed the night in the hut and slept on the bed which used to be vasudeva's bed many questions he posed to the friend of his youth many things siddhartha had to tell him from his lifewhen in the next morning the time had come to start the day's journey govinda said not without hesitation these words before i'll continue on my path siddhartha permit me to ask one more question do you have a teaching do you have a faith or a knowledge you follow which helps you to live and to do rightquoth siddhartha   i already as a young man in those days when we lived with the penitents in the forest started to distrust teachers and teachings and to turn my back to them i have stuck with this nevertheless i have had many teachers since then a beautiful courtesan a rich merchant some gamblers  a follower of buddha  but most of all i have learned here from this river and from my predecessor the ferryman vasudeva he was a very simple person vasudeva he was no thinker but he knew what is necessary just as well as gotama he was a perfect man a saintgovinda said still oh siddhartha you love a bit to mock people as it seems to me i believe in you and know that you haven't followed a teacher but haven't you found something by yourself though you've found no teachings you still found certain thoughts certain insights which are your own and which help you to live if you would like to tell me some of these you would delight my heartquoth siddhartha i've had thoughts yes and insight again and again sometimes for an hour or for an entire day i have felt knowledge in me as one would feel life in one's heart there have been many thoughts but it would be hard for me to convey them to you look my dear govinda this is one of my thoughts which i have found wisdom cannot be passed on wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on to someone always sounds like foolishnessare you kidding asked govindai'm not kidding i'm telling you what i've found knowledge can be conveyed but not wisdom it can be found it can be lived it is possible to be carried by it miracles can be performed with it but it cannot be expressed in words and taught this was what i even as a young man sometimes suspected what has driven me away from the teachers i have found a thought govinda which you'll again regard as a joke or foolishness but which is my best thought it says the opposite of every truth is just as true that's like this any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is onesided everything is onesided which can be thought with thoughts and said with words it's all onesided all just one half all lacks completeness roundness oneness when the exalted gotama spoke in his teachings of the world he had to divide it into sansara and nirvana into deception and truth into suffering and salvation it cannot be done differently there is no other way for him who wants to teach but the world itself what exists around us and inside of us is never onesided a person or an act is never entirely sansara or entirely nirvana a person is never entirely holy or entirely sinful it does really seem like this because we are subject to deception as if time was something real time is not real govinda i have experienced this often and often again and if time is not real then the gap which seems to be between the world and the eternity between suffering and blissfulness between evil and good is also a deceptionhow come asked govinda timidlylisten well my dear listen well the sinner which i am and which you are is a sinner but in times to come he will be brahma again he will reach the nirvana will be buddhaand now see these 'times to come' are a deception are only a parable the sinner is not on his way to become a buddha he is not in the process of developing though our capacity for thinking does not know how else to picture these things no within the sinner is now and today already the future buddha his future is already all there you have to worship in him in you in everyone the buddha which is coming into being the possible the hidden buddha the world my friend govinda is not imperfect or on a slow path towards perfection no it is perfect in every moment all sin already carries the divine forgiveness in itself all small children already have the old person in themselves all infants already have death all dying people the eternal life it is not possible for any person to see how far another one has already progressed on his path in the robber and dicegambler the buddha is waiting in the brahman the robber is waiting in deep meditation there is the possibility to put time out of existence to see all life which was is and will be as if it was simultaneous and there everything is good everything is perfect everything is brahman therefore i see whatever exists as good death is to me like life sin like holiness wisdom like foolishness everything has to be as it is everything only requires my consent only my willingness my loving agreement to be good for me to do nothing but work for my benefit to be unable to ever harm me i have experienced on my body and on my soul that i needed sin very much i needed lust the desire for possessions vanity and needed the most shameful despair in order to learn how to give up all resistance in order to learn how to love the world in order to stop comparing it to some world i wished i imagined some kind of perfection i had made up but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy being a part of itthese oh govinda are some of the thoughts which have come into my mindsiddhartha bent down picked up a stone from the ground and weighed it in his handthis here he said playing with it is a stone and will after a certain time perhaps turn into soil and will turn from soil into a plant or animal or human being in the past i would have said this stone is just a stone it is worthless it belongs to the world of the maja but because it might be able to become also a human being and a spirit in the cycle of transformations therefore i also grant it importance thus i would perhaps have thought in the past but today i think this stone is a stone it is also animal it is also god it is also buddha i do not venerate and love it because it could turn into this or that but rather because it is already and always everything and it is this very fact that it is a stone that it appears to me now and today as a stone this is why i love it and see worth and purpose in each of its veins and cavities in the yellow in the gray in the hardness in the sound it makes when i knock at it in the dryness or wetness of its surface there are stones which feel like oil or soap and others like leaves others like sand and every one is special and prays the om in its own way each one is brahman but simultaneously and just as much it is a stone is oily or juicy and this is this very fact which i like and regard as wonderful and worthy of worshipbut let me speak no more of this the words are not good for the secret meaning everything always becomes a bit different as soon as it is put into words gets distorted a bit a bit sillyyes and this is also very good and i like it a lot i also very much agree with this that this what is one man's treasure and wisdom always sounds like foolishness to another persongovinda listened silentlywhy have you told me this about the stone he asked hesitantly after a pausei did it without any specific intention or perhaps what i meant was that love this very stone and the river and all these things we are looking at and from which we can learn i can love a stone govinda and also a tree or a piece of bark this are things and things can be loved but i cannot love words therefore teachings are no good for me they have no hardness no softness no colours no edges no smell no taste they have nothing but words perhaps it are these which keep you from finding peace perhaps it are the many words because salvation and virtue as well sansara and nirvana as well are mere words govinda there is no thing which would be nirvana there is just the word nirvanaquoth govinda not just a word my friend is nirvana it is a thoughtsiddhartha continued a thought it might be so i must confess to you my dear i don't differentiate much between thoughts and words to be honest i also have no high opinion of thoughts i have a better opinion of things here on this ferryboat for instance a man has been my predecessor and teacher a holy man who has for many years simply believed in the river nothing else he had noticed that the river's spoke to him he learned from it it educated and taught him the river seemed to be a god to him for many years he did not know that every wind every cloud every bird every beetle was just as divine and knows just as much and can teach just as much as the worshipped river but when this holy man went into the forests he knew everything knew more than you and me without teachers without books only because he had believed in the rivergovinda said but is that what you call things' actually something real something which has existence isn't it just a deception of the maja just an image and illusion your stone your tree your river are they actually a realitythis too spoke siddhartha i do not care very much about let the things be illusions or not after all i would then also be an illusion and thus they are always like me this is what makes them so dear and worthy of veneration for me they are like me therefore i can love them and this is now a teaching you will laugh about love oh govinda seems to me to be the most important thing of all to thoroughly understand the world to explain it to despise it may be the thing great thinkers do but i'm only interested in being able to love the world not to despise it not to hate it and me to be able to look upon it and me and all beings with love and admiration and great respectthis i understand spoke govinda but this very thing was discovered by the exalted one to be a deception he commands benevolence clemency sympathy tolerance but not love he forbade us to tie our heart in love to earthly thingsi know it said siddhartha his smile shone golden i know it govinda and behold with this we are right in the middle of the thicket of opinions in the dispute about words for i cannot deny my words of love are in a contradiction a seeming contradiction with gotama's words for this very reason i distrust in words so much for i know this contradiction is a deception i know that i am in agreement with gotama how should he not know love he who has discovered all elements of human existence in their transitoriness in their meaninglessness and yet loved people thus much to use a long laborious life only to help them to teach them even with him even with your great teacher i prefer the thing over the words place more importance on his acts and life than on his speeches more on the gestures of his hand than his opinions not in his speech not in his thoughts i see his greatness only in his actions in his lifefor a long time the two old men said nothing then spoke govinda while bowing for a farewell i thank you siddhartha for telling me some of your thoughts they are partially strange thoughts not all have been instantly understandable to me this being as it may i thank you and i wish you to have calm daysbut secretly he thought to himself this siddhartha is a bizarre person he expresses bizarre thoughts his teachings sound foolish so differently sound the exalted one's pure teachings clearer purer more comprehensible nothing strange foolish or silly is contained in them but different from his thoughts seemed to me siddhartha's hands and feet his eyes his forehead his breath his smile his greeting his walk never again after our exalted gotama has become one with the nirvana never since then have i met a person of whom i felt this is a holy man only him this siddhartha i have found to be like this may his teachings be strange may his words sound foolish out of his gaze and his hand his skin and his hair out of every part of him shines a purity shines a calmness shines a cheerfulness and mildness and holiness which i have seen in no other person since the final death of our exalted teacheras govinda thought like this and there was a conflict in his heart he once again bowed to siddhartha drawn by love deeply he bowed to him who was calmly sittingsiddhartha he spoke we have become old men it is unlikely for one of us to see the other again in this incarnation i see beloved that you have found peace i confess that i haven't found it tell me oh honourable one one more word give me something on my way which i can grasp which i can understand give me something to be with me on my path it is often hard my path often dark siddharthasiddhartha said nothing and looked at him with the ever unchanged quiet smile govinda stared at his face with fear with yearning suffering and the eternal search was visible in his look eternal notfindingsiddhartha saw it and smiledbent down to me he whispered quietly in govinda's ear bend down to me like this even closer very close kiss my forehead govindabut while govinda with astonishment and yet drawn by great love and expectation obeyed his words bent down closely to him and touched his forehead with his lips something miraculous happened to him while his thoughts were still dwelling on siddhartha's wondrous words while he was still struggling in vain and with reluctance to think away time to imagine nirvana and sansara as one while even a certain contempt for the words of his friend was fighting in him against an immense love and veneration this happened to himhe no longer saw the face of his friend siddhartha instead he saw other faces many a long sequence a flowing river of faces of hundreds of thousands which all came and disappeared and yet all seemed to be there simultaneously which all constantly changed and renewed themselves and which were still all siddhartha he saw the face of a fish a carp with an infinitely painfully opened mouth the face of a dying fish with fading eyeshe saw the face of a newborn child red and full of wrinkles distorted from cryinghe saw the face of a murderer he saw him plunging a knife into the body of another personhe saw in the same second this criminal in bondage kneeling and his head being chopped off by the executioner with one blow of his swordhe saw the bodies of men and women naked in positions and cramps of frenzied lovehe saw corpses stretched out motionless cold void he saw the heads of animals of boars of crocodiles of elephants of bulls of birdshe saw gods saw krishna saw agnihe saw all of these figures and faces in a thousand relationships with one another each one helping the other loving it hating it destroying it giving rebirth to it each one was a will to die a passionately painful confession of transitoriness and yet none of them died each one only transformed was always reborn received evermore a new face without any time having passed between the one and the other faceand all of these figures and faces rested flowed generated themselves floated along and merged with each other and they were all constantly covered by something thin without individuality of its own but yet existing like a thin glass or ice like a transparent skin a shell or mold or mask of water and this mask was smiling and this mask was siddhartha's smiling face which he govinda in this very same moment touched with his lips and govinda saw it like this this smile of the mask this smile of oneness above the flowing forms this smile of simultaneousness above the thousand births and deaths this smile of siddhartha was precisely the same was precisely of the same kind as the quiet delicate impenetrable perhaps benevolent perhaps mocking wise thousandfold smile of gotama the buddha as he had seen it himself with great respect a hundred times like this govinda knew the perfected ones are smilingnot knowing any more whether time existed whether the vision had lasted a second or a hundred years not knowing any more whether there existed a siddhartha a gotama a me and a you feeling in his innermost self as if he had been wounded by a divine arrow the injury of which tasted sweet being enchanted and dissolved in his innermost self govinda still stood for a little while bent over siddhartha's quiet face which he had just kissed which had just been the scene of all manifestations all transformations all existence the face was unchanged after under its surface the depth of the thousandfoldness had closed up again he smiled silently smiled quietly and softly perhaps very benevolently perhaps very mockingly precisely as he used to smile the exalted onedeeply govinda bowed tears he knew nothing of ran down his old face like a fire burnt the feeling of the most intimate love the humblest veneration in his heart deeply he bowed touching the ground before him who was sitting motionlessly whose smile reminded him of everything he had ever loved in his life what had ever been valuable and holy to him in his life

Ivanhoe (Chapter 1),Sir Walter Scott,ivanhoe chapter  lyricschapter ithus communed these while to their lowly domethe fullfed swine return'd with evening homecompell'd reluctant to the several stieswith din obstreperous and ungrateful criespope's odysseyin that pleasant district of merry england which is watered by the river don there extended in ancient times a large forest covering the greater part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between sheffield and the pleasant town of doncaster the remains of this extensive wood are still to be seen at the noble seats of wentworth of warncliffe park and around rotherham here haunted of yore the fabulous dragon of wantley here were fought many of the most desperate battles during the civil wars of the roses and here also flourished in ancient times those bands of gallant outlaws whose deeds have been rendered so popular in english songsuch being our chief scene the date of our story refers to a period towards the end of the reign of richard i when his return from his long captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his despairing subjects who were in the meantime subjected to every species of subordinate oppression the nobles whose power had become exorbitant during the reign of stephen and whom the prudence of henry the second had scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the crown had now resumed their ancient license in its utmost extent despising the feeble interference of the english council of state fortifying their castles increasing the number of their dependants reducing all around them to a state of vassalage and striving by every means in their power to place themselves each at the head of such forces as might enable him to make a figure in the national convulsions which appeared to be impendingthe situation of the inferior gentry or franklins as they were called who by the law and spirit of the english constitution were entitled to hold themselves independent of feudal tyranny became now unusually precarious if as was most generally the case they placed themselves under the protection of any of the petty kings in their vicinity accepted of feudal offices in his household or bound themselves by mutual treaties of alliance and protection to support him in his enterprises they might indeed purchase temporary repose but it must be with the sacrifice of that independence which was so dear to every english bosom and at the certain hazard of being involved as a party in whatever rash expedition the ambition of their protector might lead him to undertake on the other hand such and so multiplied were the means of vexation and oppression possessed by the great barons that they never wanted the pretext and seldom the will to harass and pursue even to the very edge of destruction any of their less powerful neighbours who attempted to separate themselves from their authority and to trust for their protection during the dangers of the times to their own inoffensive conduct and to the laws of the landa circumstance which greatly tended to enhance the tyranny of the nobility and the sufferings of the inferior classes arose from the consequences of the conquest by duke william of normandy four generations had not sufficed to blend the hostile blood of the normans and anglosaxons or to unite by common language and mutual interests two hostile races one of which still felt the elation of triumph while the other groaned under all the consequences of defeat the power had been completely placed in the hands of the norman nobility by the event of the battle of hastings and it had been used as our histories assure us with no moderate hand the whole race of saxon princes and nobles had been extirpated or disinherited with few or no exceptions nor were the numbers great who possessed land in the country of their fathers even as proprietors of the second or of yet inferior classes the royal policy had long been to weaken by every means legal or illegal the strength of a part of the population which was justly considered as nourishing the most inveterate antipathy to their victor all the monarchs of the norman race had shown the most marked predilection for their norman subjects the laws of the chase and many others equally unknown to the milder and more free spirit of the saxon constitution had been fixed upon the necks of the subjugated inhabitants to add weight as it were to the feudal chains with which they were loaded at court and in the castles of the great nobles where the pomp and state of a court was emulated normanfrench was the only language employed in courts of law the pleadings and judgments were delivered in the same tongue in short french was the language of honour of chivalry and even of justice while the far more manly and expressive anglosaxon was abandoned to the use of rustics and hinds who knew no other still however the necessary intercourse between the lords of the soil and those oppressed inferior beings by whom that soil was cultivated occasioned the gradual formation of a dialect compounded betwixt the french and the anglosaxon in which they could render themselves mutually intelligible to each other and from this necessity arose by degrees the structure of our present english language in which the speech of the victors and the vanquished have been so happily blended together and which has since been so richly improved by importations from the classical languages and from those spoken by the southern nations of europethis state of things i have thought it necessary to premise for the information of the general reader who might be apt to forget that although no great historical events such as war or insurrection mark the existence of the anglosaxons as a separate people subsequent to the reign of william the second yet the great national distinctions betwixt them and their conquerors the recollection of what they had formerly been and to what they were now reduced continued down to the reign of edward the third to keep open the wounds which the conquest had inflicted and to maintain a line of separation betwixt the descendants of the victor normans and the vanquished saxonsthe sun was setting upon one of the rich grassy glades of that forest which we have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter hundreds of broadheaded shortstemmed widebranched oaks which had witnessed perhaps the stately march of the roman soldiery flung their gnarled arms over a thick carpet of the most delicious green sward in some places they were intermingled with beeches hollies and copsewood of various descriptions so closely as totally to intercept the level beams of the sinking sun in others they receded from each other forming those long sweeping vistas in the intricacy of which the eye delights to lose itself while imagination considers them as the paths to yet wilder scenes of silvan solitude here the red rays of the sun shot a broken and discoloured light that partially hung upon the shattered boughs and mossy trunks of the trees and there they illuminated in brilliant patches the portions of turf to which they made their way a considerable open space in the midst of this glade seemed formerly to have been dedicated to the rites of druidical superstition for on the summit of a hillock so regular as to seem artificial there still remained part of a circle of rough unhewn stones of large dimensions seven stood upright the rest had been dislodged from their places probably by the zeal of some convert to christianity and lay some prostrate near their former site and others on the side of the hill one large stone only had found its way to the bottom and in stopping the course of a small brook which glided smoothly round the foot of the eminence gave by its opposition a feeble voice of murmur to the placid and elsewhere silent streamletthe human figures which completed this landscape were in number two partaking in their dress and appearance of that wild and rustic character which belonged to the woodlands of the westriding of yorkshire at that early period the eldest of these men had a stern savage and wild aspect his garment was of the simplest form imaginable being a close jacket with sleeves composed of the tanned skin of some animal on which the hair had been originally left but which had been worn off in so many places that it would have been difficult to distinguish from the patches that remained to what creature the fur had belonged this primeval vestment reached from the throat to the knees and served at once all the usual purposes of bodyclothing there was no wider opening at the collar than was necessary to admit the passage of the head from which it may be inferred that it was put on by slipping it over the head and shoulders in the manner of a modern shirt or ancient hauberk sandals bound with thongs made of boars' hide protected the feet and a roll of thin leather was twined artificially round the legs and ascending above the calf left the knees bare like those of a scottish highlander to make the jacket sit yet more close to the body it was gathered at the middle by a broad leathern belt secured by a brass buckle to one side of which was attached a sort of scrip and to the other a ram's horn accoutred with a mouthpiece for the purpose of blowing in the same belt was stuck one of those long broad sharppointed and twoedged knives with a buck'shorn handle which were fabricated in the neighbourhood and bore even at this early period the name of a sheffield whittle the man had no covering upon his head which was only defended by his own thick hair matted and twisted together and scorched by the influence of the sun into a rusty darkred colour forming a contrast with the overgrown beard upon his cheeks which was rather of a yellow or amber hue one part of his dress only remains but it is too remarkable to be suppressed it was a brass ring resembling a dog's collar but without any opening and soldered fast round his neck so loose as to form no impediment to his breathing yet so tight as to be incapable of being removed excepting by the use of the file on this singular gorget was engraved in saxon characters an inscription of the following purportgurth the son of beowulph is the born thrall of cedric of rotherwoodbeside the swineherd for such was gurth's occupation was seated upon one of the fallen druidical monuments a person about ten years younger in appearance and whose dress though resembling his companion's in form was of better materials and of a more fantastic appearance his jacket had been stained of a bright purple hue upon which there had been some attempt to paint grotesque ornaments in different colours to the jacket he added a short cloak which scarcely reached half way down his thigh it was of crimson cloth though a good deal soiled lined with bright yellow and as he could transfer it from one shoulder to the other or at his pleasure draw it all around him its width contrasted with its want of longitude formed a fantastic piece of drapery he had thin silver bracelets upon his arms and on his neck a collar of the same metal bearing the inscription wamba the son of witless is the thrall of cedric of rotherwood this personage had the same sort of sandals with his companion but instead of the roll of leather thong his legs were cased in a sort of gaiters of which one was red and the other yellow he was provided also with a cap having around it more than one bell about the size of those attached to hawks which jingled as he turned his head to one side or other and as he seldom remained a minute in the same posture the sound might be considered as incessant around the edge of this cap was a stiff bandeau of leather cut at the top into open work resembling a coronet while a prolonged bag arose from within it and fell down on one shoulder like an oldfashioned nightcap or a jellybag or the headgear of a modern hussar it was to this part of the cap that the bells were attached which circumstance as well as the shape of his headdress and his own halfcrazed halfcunning expression of countenance sufficiently pointed him out as belonging to the race of domestic clowns or jesters maintained in the houses of the wealthy to help away the tedium of those lingering hours which they were obliged to spend within doors he bore like his companion a scrip attached to his belt but had neither horn nor knife being probably considered as belonging to a class whom it is esteemed dangerous to intrust with edgetools in place of these he was equipped with a sword of lath resembling that with which harlequin operates his wonders upon the modern stagethe outward appearance of these two men formed scarce a stronger contrast than their look and demeanour that of the serf or bondsman was sad and sullen his aspect was bent on the ground with an appearance of deep dejection which might be almost construed into apathy had not the fire which occasionally sparkled in his red eye manifested that there slumbered under the appearance of sullen despondency a sense of oppression and a disposition to resistance the looks of wamba on the other hand indicated as usual with his class a sort of vacant curiosity and fidgetty impatience of any posture of repose together with the utmost selfsatisfaction respecting his own situation and the appearance which he made the dialogue which they maintained between them was carried on in anglosaxon which as we said before was universally spoken by the inferior classes excepting the norman soldiers and the immediate personal dependants of the great feudal nobles but to give their conversation in the original would convey but little information to the modern reader for whose benefit we beg to offer the following translationthe curse of st withold upon these infernal porkers said the swineherd after blowing his horn obstreperously to collect together the scattered herd of swine which answering his call with notes equally melodious made however no haste to remove themselves from the luxurious banquet of beechmast and acorns on which they had fattened or to forsake the marshy banks of the rivulet where several of them half plunged in mud lay stretched at their ease altogether regardless of the voice of their keeper the curse of st withold upon them and upon me said gurth if the twolegged wolf snap not up some of them ere nightfall i am no true man here fangs fangs he ejaculated at the top of his voice to a ragged wolfishlooking dog a sort of lurcher half mastiff half greyhound which ran limping about as if with the purpose of seconding his master in collecting the refractory grunters but which in fact from misapprehension of the swineherd's signals ignorance of his own duty or malice prepense only drove them hither and thither and increased the evil which he seemed to design to remedy a devil draw the teeth of him said gurth and the mother of mischief confound the ranger of the forest that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs and makes them unfit for their trade  wamba up and help me an thou be'st a man take a turn round the back o' the hill to gain the wind on them and when thous't got the weathergage thou mayst drive them before thee as gently as so many innocent lambstruly said wamba without stirring from the spot i have consulted my legs upon this matter and they are altogether of opinion that to carry my gay garments through these sloughs would be an act of unfriendship to my sovereign person and royal wardrobe wherefore gurth i advise thee to call off fangs and leave the herd to their destiny which whether they meet with bands of travelling soldiers or of outlaws or of wandering pilgrims can be little else than to be converted into normans before morning to thy no small ease and comfortthe swine turned normans to my comfort quoth gurth expound that to me wamba for my brain is too dull and my mind too vexed to read riddleswhy how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four legs demanded wambaswine fool swine said the herd every fool knows thatand swine is good saxon said the jester but how call you the sow when she is flayed and drawn and quartered and hung up by the heels like a traitorpork answered the swineherdi am very glad every fool knows that too said wamba and pork i think is good normanfrench and so when the brute lives and is in the charge of a saxon slave she goes by her saxon name but becomes a norman and is called pork when she is carried to the castlehall to feast among the nobles what dost thou think of this friend gurth hait is but too true doctrine friend wamba however it got into thy fool's patenay i can tell you more said wamba in the same tone there is old alderman ox continues to hold his saxon epithet while he is under the charge of serfs and bondsmen such as thou but becomes beef a fiery french gallant when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are destined to consume him mynheer calf too becomes monsieur de veau in the like manner he is saxon when he requires tendance and takes a norman name when he becomes matter of enjoymentby st dunstan answered gurth thou speakest but sad truths little is left to us but the air we breathe and that appears to have been reserved with much hesitation solely for the purpose of enabling us to endure the tasks they lay upon our shoulders the finest and the fattest is for their board the loveliest is for their couch the best and bravest supply their foreign masters with soldiers and whiten distant lands with their bones leaving few here who have either will or the power to protect the unfortunate saxon god's blessing on our master cedric he hath done the work of a man in standing in the gap but reginald frontdeboeuf is coming down to this country in person and we shall soon see how little cedric's trouble will avail himhere here he exclaimed again raising his voice so ho so ho well done fangs thou hast them all before thee now and bring'st them on bravely ladgurth said the jester i know thou thinkest me a fool or thou wouldst not be so rash in putting thy head into my mouth one word to reginald frontdeboeuf or philip de malvoisin that thou hast spoken treason against the normanand thou art but a castaway swineherdthou wouldst waver on one of these trees as a terror to all evil speakers against dignitiesdog thou wouldst not betray me said gurth after having led me on to speak so much at disadvantagebetray thee answered the jester no that were the trick of a wise man a fool cannot half so well help himselfbut soft whom have we here he said listening to the trampling of several horses which became then audiblenever mind whom answered gurth who had now got his herd before him and with the aid of fangs was driving them down one of the long dim vistas which we have endeavoured to describenay but i must see the riders answered wamba perhaps they are come from fairyland with a message from king oberona murrain take thee rejoined the swineherd wilt thou talk of such things while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning is raging within a few miles of us hark how the thunder rumbles and for summer rain i never saw such broad downright flat drops fall out of the clouds the oaks too notwithstanding the calm weather sob and creak with their great boughs as if announcing a tempest thou canst play the rational if thou wilt credit me for once and let us home ere the storm begins to rage for the night will be fearfulwamba seemed to feel the force of this appeal and accompanied his companion who began his journey after catching up a long quarterstaff which lay upon the grass beside him this second eumaeus strode hastily down the forest glade driving before him with the assistance of fangs the whole herd of his inharmonious charge

The Golden Ass - Book 11,Lucius Apuleius,the golden ass  book  lyricsthe fortyseventh chapterhow apuleius by roses and prayer returned to his humane shapewhen midnight came that i had slept my first sleepe i awaked with suddaine feare and saw the moone shining bright as when shee is at the full and seeming as though she leaped out of the sea then thought i with my selfe that that was the most secret time when the goddesse ceres had most puissance and force considering that all humane things be governed by her providence and not onely all beasts private and tame but also all wild and savage beasts be under her protection and considering that all bodies in the heavens the earth and the seas be by her increasing motions increased and by her diminishing motions diminished as weary of all my cruell fortune and calamity i found good hope and soveraigne remedy though it were very late to be delivered from all my misery by invocation and prayer to the excellent beauty of the goddesse whom i saw shining before mine eyes wherefore shaking off mine assie and drowsie sleepe i arose with a joyfull face and mooved by a great affection to purifie my selfe i plunged my selfe seven times into the water of the sea which number of seven is conveniable and agreeable to holy and divine things as the worthy and sage philosopher pythagoras hath declared then with a weeping countenance i made this orison to the puissant goddesse saying o blessed queene of heaven whether thou be the dame ceres which art the originall and motherly nource of all fruitfull things in earth who after the finding of thy daughter proserpina through the great joy which thou diddest presently conceive madest barraine and unfruitfull ground to be plowed and sowne and now thou inhabitest in the land of eleusie or whether thou be the celestiall venus who in the beginning of the world diddest couple together all kind of things with an ingendered love by an eternall propagation of humane kind art now worshipped within the temples of the ile paphos thou which art the sister of the god phbus who nourishest so many people by the generation of beasts and art now adored at the sacred places of ephesus thou which art horrible proserpina by reason of the deadly howlings which thou yeeldest thou hast the power to stoppe and put away the invasion of the hags and ghoasts which appeare unto men and to keepe them downe in the closures of the earth thou which nourishest all the fruits of the world by thy vigor and force with whatsoever name or fashion it is lawfull to call upon thee i pray thee to end my great travaile and misery and deliver mee from the wretched fortune which had so long time pursued me grant peace and rest if it please thee to my adversities for i have endured too too  much labour and perill remoove from me my shape of mine asse and render to me my pristine estate and if i have offended in any point of divine majesty let me rather dye then live for i am full weary of life when i had ended this orison and discovered my plaints to the goddesse i fortuned to fall asleepe and by and by appeared unto me a divine and venerable face worshipped even of the gods themselves then by little and little i seemed to see the whole figure of her body mounting out of the sea and standing before mee wherefore i purpose to describe her divine semblance if the poverty of my humane speech will suffer me or her divine power give me eloquence thereto first shee had a great abundance of haire dispersed and scattered about her neck on the crowne of her head she bare many garlands enterlaced with floures in the middle of her forehead was a compasse in fashion of a glasse or resembling the light of the moone in one of her hands she bare serpents in the other blades of corne her vestiment was of fine silke yeelding divers colours sometime yellow sometime rosie sometime flamy and sometime which troubled my spirit sore darke and obscure covered with a blacke robe in manner of a shield and pleated in most subtill fashion at the skirts of her garments the welts appeared comely whereas here and there the starres glimpsed and in the middle of them was placed the moone which shone like a flame of fire round about the robe was a coronet or garland made with flowers and fruits in her right hand shee had a timbrell of brasse which gave a pleasant sound in her left hand shee bare a cup of gold out of the mouth whereof the serpent aspis lifted up his head with a swelling throat her odoriferous feete were covered with shoes interlaced and wrought with victorious palme thus the divine shape breathing out the pleasant spice of fertill arabia disdained not with her divine voyce to utter these words unto me behold lucius i am come thy weeping and prayers hath mooved mee to succour thee i am she that is the naturall mother of all things mistresse and governesse of all the elements the initiall progeny of worlds chiefe of powers divine queene of heaven the principall of the gods celestiall the light of the goddesses at my will the planets of the ayre the wholesome winds of the seas and the silences of hell be disposed my name my divinity is adored throughout all the world in divers manners in variable customes and in many names for the phrygians call me the mother of the gods the athenians minerva the cyprians venus the candians diana the sicilians proserpina the eleusians ceres some juno other bellona other hecate and principally the thiopians which dwell in the orient and the gyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine and by their proper ceremonies accustome to worship mee doe call mee queene isis behold i am come to take pitty of thy fortune and tribulation behold i am present to favour and ayd thee leave off thy weeping and lamentation put away thy sorrow for behold the healthfull day which is ordained by my providence therefore be ready to attend to my commandement this day which shall come after this night is dedicated to my service by an eternall religion my priests and ministers doe accustome after the tempests of the sea be ceased to offer in my name a new ship as a first fruit of my navigation i command thee not to prophane or despise the sacrifice in any wise for the great priest shall carry this day following in procession by my exhortation a garland of roses next the timbrell of his right hand follow thou my procession amongst the people and when thou commest to the priest make as though thou wouldest kisse his hand but snatch at the roses whereby i will put away the skin and shape of an asse which kind of beast i have long time abhorred and despised but above all beware thou doubt not nor feare any of those things as hard and difficill to bee brought to passe for in the same houre that i am come to thee i have commanded the priest by a vision what he shall doe and all the people by my commandement shall be compelled to give thee place and say nothing moreover thinke not that amongst so faire and joyfull ceremonies and in so good a company that any person shall abhorre thy illfavoured and deformed figure or that any man shall be so hardy as to blame and reprove thy suddaine restoration to humane shape wherby they should gather or conceive any sinister opinion and know thou this of certaine that the residue of thy life untill the houre of death shall be bound and subject to me and think it not an injury to be alwayes serviceable towards me since as by my meane and benefit thou shalt live glorious by my guide and protection and when thou descendest to hell where thou shalt see me shine in that subterene place shining as thou seest me now in the darkness of acheron and raigning in the deepe profundity of stix thou shalt worship me as one that hath been favourable to thee and if i perceive that thou art obedient to my commandement addict to my religion and merite my divine grace know thou that i will prolong thy daies above the time that the fates have appointed and the celestial planets ordeined when the divine image had spoken these words she vanished away by and by when i awaked i arose haveing the members of my bodie mixed with feare joy and sweate and marvailed at the cleare presence of the puissant goddesse and being sprinkled with the water of the sea i recounted orderly her admonition and divine commandements soone after the darknes chased away and the cleare and golden sunne arose whenas behold i saw the streets replenished with people going in a religious sort and in great triumph all things seemed that day to be joyfull as well all manner of beasts and houses as also the very day it selfe seemed to rejoyce for after the horefrost ensued the hot and temperat sun whereby the little birds weening that the spring time had bin come did chirp and sing in their steven melodiously the mother of stars the parent of times and mistres of all the world the fruitful trees rejoyced at their fertility the barren and sterill were contented at their shadow rendering sweete and pleasant shrills the seas were quiet from winds and tempests the heaven had chaced away the clouds and appeared faire and cleare with his proper light behold then more and more appeared the pomps and processions attired in regall manner and singing joyfully one was girded about the middle like a man of armes another bare and spare and had a cloake and highshooes like a hunter another was attired in a robe of silke and socks of gold having his haire laid out and dressed in forme of a woman there was another ware leggedharnesse and bare a target a sallet and a speare like a martial souldier after him marched one attired in purple with vergers before him like a magistrate after him followed one with a maurell   a staffe a paire of pantofles and with a gray beard signifying a philosopher after him went one with lime betokening a fowler another with hookes declaring a fisher i saw there a meeke and tame beare which in matron habite was carried on a stoole an ape with a bonet on his head and covered with lawne   resemling  a shepheard and bearing a cup of gold in his hand an asse which had wings glewed to his backe and went after an old man whereby you would judge the one to be pegasus and the other bellephoron amongst the pleasures and popular delectations which wandered hither and thither you might see the pompe of the goddesse triumphantly march forward the woman  attired in white vestiments and rejoysing in that they bare garlands and flowres upon their heads bespread the waies with hearbes which they bare in their aprons where this regall and devout procession should passe other caried glasses on their backes to testifie obeysance to the goddes which came after other bare combes of ivory and declared by their gesture and motions of their armes that they were ordained and readie to dresse the goddesse others dropped in the wayes as they went balme and other pretious ointments then came a great number as well of men as women with candels torches and other lights doing honour to the celestiall goddesse after that sounded the musicall harmony of instruments then came a faire companie of youth apparelled in white vestiments singing both meeter and verse with a comely grace which some studious poet had made in honour of the muses in the meane season arrived the blowers of trumpets which were dedicated unto serapis and to the temple before them were officers and bedles preparing roome for the goddes to passe then came the great company of men and women which had taken divine orders whose garments glistered all the streets over the women had their haire annointed and their heads covered with linnen but the men had their crowns shaven which were the terrene stars of the goddesse holding in their hands instruments of brasse silver and gold which rendered a pleasant sound the principall priests which were apparelled with white surplesses hanging downe to the ground bare the relikes of the puissant goddesse one carried in his hand a light not unlike to those which we used in our houses saving that in the middle thereof appeared a bole which rendred a more bright flame the second attired like the other bare in his hand an altar which the goddesse her selfe named the succour of the nations the third held a tree of palme with leaves of gold and the verge of mercurie the fourth shewed out a token of equitie by his left hand which was deformed in every place signifiing thereby more equitie then by the right hand the same priest carried a round vessell of gold in forme of a cap the fift bare a van wrought with springs of gold and another carried a vessell for wine by and by after the goddesse followed a foot as men do and specially mercurie the messenger of the goddesse infernall and supernall with his face sometime black sometime faire lifting up the head of the dogges annubis and bearing in his left hand his verge and in his right hand the branches of a palme tree after whom followed a cow with an upright gate representing the figure of the great goddesse and he that guided her marched on with much gravity another carried after the secrets of their religion closed in a coffer there was one that bare on his stomacke a figure of his god not formed like any beast bird savage thing or human shape but made by a new invention whereby was signified that such a religion should not be discovered or revealed to any person there was a vessell wrought with a round bottome haveing on the one side pictures figured like unto the manner of the egyptians and on the other side was an eare whereupon stoode the serpent aspis holding out his scaly necke finally came he which was apointed to my good fortun according to the promise of the goddesse for the great priest which bare the restoration of my human shape by the commandement of the goddes approached more and more bearing in his left hand the timbrill and in the other a garland of roses to give me to the end i might be delivered from cruel fortune which was alwaies mine enemie after the sufferance of so much calamitie and paine and after the endurance of so manie perilles then i not returning hastilie by reason of sodaine joye lest i should disturbe the quiet procession with mine importunitie but going softly through the prease of the people which gave me place on every side went after the priest the priest being admonished the night before as i might well perceive stood still and holding out his hand thrust out the garland of roses into my mouth i trembling devoured with a great affection and as soone as i had eaten them i was not deceived of the promise made unto me for my deforme and assie face abated and first the rugged haire of my body fell off my thick skin waxed soft and tender the hoves of my feet changes into toes my hands returned againe my neck grew short my head and mouth began round my long eares were made little my great and stonie teeth waxed less like the teeth of men and my tayle which combred me most appeared no where then the people began to marvaile and the religious honoured the goddesse for so evident a miracle they wondered at the visions which they saw in the night and the facilitie of my reformation whereby they rendered testimonie of so great a benefit which i received of the goddesse when i saw my selfe in such estate i stood still a good space and said nothing for i could not tell what to say nor what word i shoulde first speake nor what thanks i should render to the goddesse but the great priest understanding all my fortune and miserie by divine advertisement commanded that one should give me garments to cover me howbeit as soone as i was transformed from an asse to my humane shape i hid the privitie of my body with my hands as shame and necessity compelled mee then one of the company put off his upper robe and put it on my backe which done the priest looked upon me with a sweete and benigne voice gan say in this sort o my friend lucius after the endurance of so many labours and the escape of so many tempests of fortune thou art at length come to the port and haven of rest and mercy neither did thy noble linage thy dignity thy doctrine or any thing prevaile but that thou hast endured so many servil pleasures by a little folly of thy youthfullnes whereby thou hast had a sinister reward for thy unprosperous curiositie but howsoever the blindnes of fortune tormented thee in divers dangers so it is that now unawares to her thou art come to this present felicitie let fortune go and fume with fury in another place let her finde some other matter to execute her cruelty for fortune hath no puissance against them which serve and honour our goddesse for what availed the theeves the beasts savage thy great servitude the ill and dangerous waies the long passages the feare of death every day know thou that now thou art safe and under the protection of her who by her cleare light doth lighten the other gods wherefore rejoyce and take a convenable countenance to thy white habit follow the pomp of this devout and honorable procession to the end that such which be not devout to the goddes may see and acknowledge their errour behold lucius thou art delivered from so great miseries by the providence of the goddesse isis rejoyce therefore and triumph of the victory of fortune to the end thou maist live more safe and sure make thy selfe one of this holy order dedicate thy minde to the obsequy of our religion and take upon thee a voluntary yoake of ministrie and when thou beginnest to serve and honour the goddes then thou shalt feele the fruit of thy liberty after that the great priest had prophesied in this manner with often breathings he made a conclusion of his words then i went amongst the company of the rest and followed the procession everie one of the people knew me and pointing at me with their fingers said in this sort behold him who is this day transformed into a man by the puissance of the soveraigne goddesse verily he is blessed and most blessed that hath merited so great grace from heaven as by the innocencie of his former life and as it were by a new regeneration is reserved to the obsequie of the goddesse in the meane season by little and little we approached nigh unto the sea cost even to that place where i lay the night before being an asse there after the images and reliques were orderly disposed the great priest compassed about with divers pictures according to the fashion of the gyptians did dedicate and consecrate with certaine prayers a fair ship made very cunningly and purified the same with a torch an egge and sulphur the saile was of white linnen cloath whereon was written certaine letters which testified the navigation to be prosperous the mast was of a great length made of a pine tree round and very excellent with a shining top the cabin was covered over with coverings of gold and all the shippe was made of citron tree very faire then all the people as well religious as prophane tooke a great number of vannes replenished with odours and pleasant smells and threw them into the sea mingled with milke untill the ship was filled up with large gifts and prosperous devotions when as with a pleasant wind it lanched out into the deep but when they had lost the sight of the ship every man caried againe that he brought and went toward the temple in like pompe and order as they came to the sea side when we were come to the temple the divine figures but especially those which had long time bin worshippers of the religion went into the secret chamber of the goddesse where they put and placed the images according to their ordor  this done one of the company which was a scribe or interpreter of letters who in forme of a preacher stood up in a chaire before the place of the holy college and began to reade out of a booke and to interpret to the great prince the senate and to all the noble order of chivalry and generally to all the romane people and to all such as be under the jurisdiction of rome these words following laois aphesus which signified the end of their divin service and that it was lawfull for every man to depart whereat all the people gave a great showt and replenished with much joy bare all kind of hearbs and garlands of flowers home to their houses kissing and imbracing the steps where the goddesse passed howbeit i could not doe as the rest for my mind would not suffer me to depart one foot away so attentiv was i to behold the beauty of the goddesse with remembrance of the great miserie i had enduredthe fortyeighth chapterhow the parents and friends of apuleius heard news that he was alive and in good healthin the meane season newes was carried into my countrey as swift as the flight of birds or as the blast of windes of the grace and benefit which i received of the goddesse and of my fortune worthy to be had in memory then my parents friends and servants of our house understanding that i was not dead as they were falsely informed came towards me with great diligence to see me as a man raised from death to life and i which never thought to see them againe was as joyfull as they accepting and taking in good part their honest gifts and oblations that they gave to the intent i might buy such things as was necessarie for my body for after i had made relation unto them of all my pristine miserie and present joyes i went before the face of the goddesse and hired me a house within the cloister of the temple to the end i might continually be ready to the service of the goddesse and ordinarily frequent the company of the priests whereby i would wholy become devout to the goddesse and an inseparable worshipper of her divine name it fortuned that the goddesse appeared to me oftentimes in the night perswading and commanding me to take the order of her religion but i though i was indued with a desirous good will yet the feare of the same withheld me considering her obeysance was hard and difficile the chastitie of the priests intolerable and the life fraile and subject to manie inconveniences being thus in doubt i refrained my selfe from all those things as seemed impossibleon a night the great priest appeared unto me presenting his lap full of treasure and when i demanded what it signified he answered that it was sent me from the countrey of thessaly and that a servant of mine named candidus was arived likewise when i was awake i mused in my selfe what this vision should pretend considering i had never any servant called by that name but what soever it did signifie this i verely thought that it was a foreshew of gaine and prosperous chance while i was thus astonied i went to the temple and taried there till the opening of the gates then i went in and began to pray before the face of the goddesse the priest prepared and set the divine things of every altar and pulled out the fountaine and holy vessell with solempne  supplication then they began to sing the mattens of the morning testifying thereby the houre of the prime by and by behold arived my servant which i had left in the country when fotis by errour made me an asse bringing with him my horse recovered by her through certaine signes and tokens which i had upon my backe then i perceived the interpretation of my dreame by reason that beside the promise of gaine my white horse was restored to me which was signified by the argument of my servant candidusthis done i retired to the service of the goddesse in hope of greater benefits considering i had received a signe and token whereby my courage increased every day more and more to take upon me the orders and sacraments of the temple insomuch that i oftentimes communed with the priest desiring him greatly to give me the degree of the religion but he which was a man of gravitie and well renowned in the order of priesthood deferred my affection from day to day with comfort and better hope as parents commonly bridle the desires of their children when they attempt or indeavour any unprofitable thing saying that the day when any one should be admitted into their order is appointed by the goddesse the priest which should minister the sacrifices is chosen by her providence and the necessary charges of the ceremonies is alotted by her commandement all which things he willed me to attend with marvailous patience and that i should beware either of too much hastinesse or too great slacknesse considering that there was like danger if being called i should delay or not called i should be hasty moreover he said that there was none of his company either of so desperate a mind or so rash and hardy as to enterprise any thing without the commandement of the goddesse whereby he should commit a deadly offence considering that it was in her power to damne and save all persons and if any were at the point of death and in the way to damnation so that he were capable to receive the secrets of the goddesse it was in her power by divine providence to reduce him to the path of health as by a certaine kind of regeneration finally he said that i must attend the celestiall precept   although it was evident and plaine that the goddesse had already vouchsafed to call and appoint me to her ministery and to will me to refraine from prophane and unlawfull meates as those priests which were already received to the end i might come more apt and cleane to the knowledge of the secrets of religion then was i obedient unto these words and attentive with meek quietnesse and probable taciturnity i daily served at the temple in the end the wholesome gentlenesse of the goddesse did nothing deceive me for in the night she appeared to me in a vision shewing that the day was come which i had wished for so long she told me what provision and charges i should be at and how that she had appointed her principallest priest mythra to be minister with me in my sacrificeswhen i heard these divine commandements i greatly rejoyced and arose before day to speake with the great priest whom i fortuned to espie comming out of his chamber then i saluted him and thought with my selfe to aske and demand his counsell with a bold courage but as soone as he perceived me he began first to say o lucius now know i well that thou art most happy and blessed whom the divine goddesse doth so greatly accept with mercy why dost thou delay behold the day which thou desiredst when as thou shalt receive at my hands the order of religion and know the most pure secrets of the gods whereupon the old man tooke me by the hand and lead me to the gate of the great temple where at the first entrie he made a solemnpne  celebration and after morning sacrifice ended brought out of the secret place of the temple books partly written with unknown characters and partly painted with figures of beasts declaring briefly every sentence with tops and tailes turning in fashion of a wheele which were strange and impossible to be read of the prophane people there he interpreted to me such things as were necessary to the use and preparation of mine order this done i gave charge to certaine of my companions to buy liberally whatsoever was needfull and convenient then he brought me to the next bains accompanied with all the religious sort and demanding pardon of the goddesse washed me and purified my body according to custome after this when noone approached he brought me backe againe to the temple presented me before the face of the goddesse giving a charge of certaine secret things unlawfull to be uttered and commanding me and generally all the rest to fast by the space of ten continuall daies without eating of any beast or drinking any wine which thing i observed with a marvellous continencie then behold the day approached when as the sacrifice should be done and when night came there arrived on every coast a great multitude of priests who according to their order offered me many presents and gifts then was all the laity and prophane people commanded to depart and when they had put on my back a linnen robe they brought me to the most secret and sacred place of all the temple you would peradventure demand you studious reader what was said and done there verely i would tell you if it were lawfull for me to tell you should know if it were convenient for you to heare but both thy eares and my tongue shall incur the like paine of rash curiositie howbeit i will content thy mind for this present time which peradventure is somewhat religious and given to some devotion listen therefore and beleeve it to be true thou shalt understand that i approached neere unto hell even to the gates of proserpina and after that i was ravished throughout all the element i returned to my proper place about midnight i saw the sun shine i saw likewise the gods celestiall and gods infernall before whom i presented my selfe and worshipped them behold now have i told thee which although thou hast heard yet it is necessarie thou conceale it this have i declared without offence for the understanding of the prophanewhen morning came and that the solemnities were finished i came forth sanctified with xii stoles and in a religious habit whereof i am not forbidden to speake considering that many persons saw me at that time there i was commanded to stand upon a seat of wood which stood in the middle of the temple before the figure and remembrance of the goddesse my vestiment was of fine linnen covered and embroidered with flowers i had a pretious cope  upon my shoulders hanging downe to the ground whereon were beasts of divers colours as indian dragons and hiperborian griphons whom in forme of birds the other world doth ingender the priests commonly call such a habit a celestiall stole in my right hand i carried a light torch and a garland of flowers upon my head with palme leaves sprouting out on every side i was adorned like unto the sun and made in fashion of an image in such sort that all the people compassed about to behold me then they began to solemnize the feast of the nativitie and the new procession with sumptuous bankets and delicate meates the third day was likewise celebrated with like ceremonies with a religious dinner and with all the consummation of the order when i had continued there a good space i conceived a marvailous great pleasure and consolation in beholding ordinarily the image of the goddesse who at length admonished me to depart homeward not without rendring of thanks which although it were not sufficient yet they were according to my power howbeit i could unneth  be perswaded to depart before i had fallen prostrate before the face of the goddesse and wiped her steps with my face whereby i began so greatly to weepe and sigh that my words were interrupted and as devouring my prayer i began to say in this sort o holy and blessed dame the perpetuall comfort of humane kind who by thy bounty and grace nourishest all the world and bearest a great affection to the adversities of the miserable as a loving mother thou takest no rest neither art thou idle at any time in giving thy benefits and succoring all men as well on land as sea thou art she that puttest away all stormes and dangers from mans life by thy right hand whereby likewise thou restrainest the fatall dispositions appeasest the great tempests of fortune and keepest backe the course of the stars the gods supernall doe honour thee the gods infernall have thee in reverence thou environest all the world thou givest light to the sunne thou governest the world thou treadest downe the power of hell by thy meane the times returne the planets rejoyce the elements serve at thy commandment the winds do blow the clouds increase the seeds prosper and the fruits prevaile the birds of the aire the beasts of the hill the serpents of the den and the fishes of the sea do tremble at thy majesty but my spirit is not able to give thee sufficient praise my patrimonie is unable to satisfie thy sacrifice my voice hath no power to utter that which i thinke no if i had a thousand mouths and so many tongues howbeit as a good religious person and according to my estate i will alwaies keepe thee in remembrance and close thee within my breast when i had ended mine orison i went to embrace the great priest mythra my spirituall father and to demand his pardon considering i was unable to recompence the good which he had done to me after great greeting and thanks i departed from him to visit my parents and friends and within a while after by the exhortation of the goddesse i made up my packet and tooke shipping toward the citie of rome where with a prosperous winde i arrived about the xii day of december and the greatest desire that i had there was daily to make my praiers to the soveraigne goddesse isis who by reason of the place where her temple was builded was called campensis and continually adored of the people of rome her minister and worshipper was i howbeit i was a stranger to her church and unknowne to her religion therewhen the yeare was ended and the goddesse warned me againe to receive this new order and consecration i marvailed greatly what it should signifie and what should happen considering that i was a sacred person already but it fortuned that while i partly reasoned with my selfe and partly examining the thing with the priests and bishops there came a new and marvailous thought in my mind that is to say i was onely religious to the goddesse isis but not sacred to the religion of great osiris the soveraigne father of all the goddesses between whom although there was a religious unitie and concord yet there was a great difference of order and ceremony and because it was necessary that i should likewise be a minister unto osiris there was no long delay for in the night after appeared unto me one of that order covered with linnen robes holding in his hands speares wrapped in ivie and other things not convenient to declare which then he left in my chamber and sitting in my seate recited to me such things as were necessary for the sumptuous banket of mine entrie and to the end i might know him againe he shewed me how the ankle of his left foote was somewhat maimed which caused him a little to haltafter that i manifestly knew the will of the god osiris when mattins was ended i went from one to another to find him out which had the halting marke on his foote according as i learned by my vision at length i found it true for i perceived one of the company of the priests who had not onely the token of his foote but the stature and habite of his body resembling in every point as he appeared in the night he was called asinius marcellus a name not much disagreeing from my transformation by and by i went to him which knew well enough all the matter as being monished by like precept in the night for the night before as he dressed the flowers and garlands about the head of the god osiris he understood by the mouth of the image which told the predestinations of all men how he had sent a poore man of madura to whom he should minister his sacraments to the end hee should receive a reward by divine providence and the other glory for his vertuous studies when i saw my selfe thus deputed unto religion my desire was stopped by reason of povertie for i had spent a great part of my goods in travell and peregrination but most of all in the citie of rome whereby my low estate withdrew me a great whilein the end being oft times stirred forward not without great trouble of mind i was constrained to sell my robe for a little money howbeit sufficient for all my affaires then the priest spake unto me saying how is it that for a little pleasure thou art not afraid to sell thy vestiments and entring into so great ceremonies fearest to fall into povertie prepare thy selfe and abstaine from all animall meats as beasts and fish in the meane season i frequented the sacrifices of serapis which were done in the night which thing gave me great comfort to my peregrination and ministred unto me more plentifull living considering i gained some money in haunting the court by reason of my latin tongueimmediately after i was eftsoones called and admonished by the god osiris to receive a third order of religion then i was greatly astonied because i could not tell what this new vision signified or what the intent of the celestiall god was doubting least the former priests had given me ill counsell and fearing that they had not faithfully instructed me being in this manner as it were incensed the god osiris appeared to me the night following and giving me admonition said there is no occasion why thou shouldest be afraid with so often order of religion as though there were somewhat omitted but that thou shouldest rather rejoyce since as it hath pleased the gods to call thee three times when as there was never yet any person that achieved to the order but once wherefore thou maist thinke thy selfe happy for so great benefits and know thou that the religion which thou must now receive is right necessary if thou meane to persever in the worshipping of the goddesse and to make solempnity  on the festivall day with the blessed habite which thing shall be a glory and renowne to theeafter this sort the divine majesty perswaded me in my sleepe whereupon by and by i went towards the priest and declared all that which i had seene then i fasted ten dayes according to the custome and of mine owne proper will i abstained longer then i was commanded and verely i did nothing repent of the paine which i had taken and of the charges which i was at considering that the divine providence had given me such an order that i gained much money in pleading of causes finally after a few dayes the great god osiris appeared to me in the night not disguised in any other forme but in his owne essence commanding me that i should be an advocate in the court and not feare the slander and envie of ill persons which beare me stomacke and grudge by reason of my doctrine which i had gotten by much labour moreover he would not that i should be any longer of the number of his priests but he allotted me to be one of the decurions and senatours and after he appointed me a place within the ancient pallace which was erected in the time of silla where i executed my office in great joy with a shaven crowne

Typee (Chap. 27),Herman Melville,typee chap  lyricsthe social condition and general character of the typeesi have already mentioned that the influence exerted over the people of the valley by their chiefs was mild in the extreme and as to any general rule or standard of conduct by which the commonality were governed in their intercourse with each other so far as my observation extended i should be almost tempted to say that none existed on the island except indeed the mysterious 'taboo' be considered as such during the time i lived among the typees no one was ever put upon his trial for any offence against the public to all appearance there were no courts of law or equity there was no municipal police for the purpose of apprehending vagrants and disorderly characters in short there were no legal provisions whatever for the wellbeing and conservation of society the enlightened end of civilized legislation and yet everything went on in the valley with a harmony and smoothness unparalleled i will venture to assert in the most select refined and pious associations of mortals in christendom how are we to explain this enigma these islanders were heathens savages ay cannibals and how came they without the aid of established law to exhibit in so eminent a degree that social order which is the greatest blessing and highest pride of the social stateit may reasonably be inquired how were these people governed how were their passions controlled in their everyday transactions it must have been by an inherent principle of honesty and charity towards each other they seemed to be governed by that sort of tacit commonsense law which say what they will of the inborn lawlessness of the human race has its precepts graven on every breast the grand principles of virtue and honour however they may be distorted by arbitrary codes are the same all the world over and where these principles are concerned the right or wrong of any action appears the same to the uncultivated as to the enlightened mind it is to this indwelling this universally diffused perception of what is just and noble that the integrity of the marquesans in their intercourse with each other is to be attributed in the darkest nights they slept securely with all their worldly wealth around them in houses the doors of which were never fastened the disquieting ideas of theft or assassination never disturbed themeach islander reposed beneath his own palmetto thatching or sat under his own breadfruit trees with none to molest or alarm him there was not a padlock in the valley nor anything that answered the purpose of one still there was no community of goods this long spear so elegantly carved and highly polished belongs to wormoonoo it is far handsomer than the one which old marheyo so greatly prizes it is the most valuable article belonging to its owner and yet i have seen it leaning against a cocoanut tree in the grove and there it was found when sought for here is a spermwhale tooth graven all over with cunning devices it is the property of karluna it is the most precious of the damsel's ornaments in her estimation its price is far above rubiesand yet there hangs the dental jewel by its cord of braided bark in the girl's house which is far back in the valley the door is left open and all the inmates have gone off to bathe in the streamthe strict honesty which the inhabitants of nearly all the polynesian islands manifest toward each other is in striking contrast with the thieving propensities some of them evince in their intercourse with foreigners it would almost seem that according to their peculiar code of morals the pilfering of a hatchet or a wrought nail from a european is looked upon as a praiseworthy action or rather it may be presumed that bearing in mind the wholesale forays made upon them by their nautical visitors they consider the property of the latter as a fair object of reprisal this consideration while it serves to reconcile an apparent contradiction in the moral character of the islanders should in some measure alter that low opinion of it which the reader of south sea voyages is too apt to formso much for the respect in which 'personal property' is held in typee how secure an investment of 'real property' may be i cannot take upon me to say whether the land of the valley was the joint property of its inhabitants or whether it was parcelled out among a certain number of landed proprietors who allowed everybody to 'squat' and 'poach' as much as he or she pleased i never could ascertain at any rate musty parchments and titledeeds there were none on the island and i am half inclined to believe that its inhabitants hold their broad valleys in fee simple from nature herself to have and to hold so long as grass grows and water runs or until their french visitors by a summary mode of conveyancing shall appropriate them to their own benefit and behoofyesterday i saw korykory hie him away armed with a long pole with which standing on the ground he knocked down the fruit from the topmost boughs of the trees and brought them home in his basket of cocoanut leaves today i see an islander whom i know to reside in a distant part of the valley doing the selfsame thing on the sloping bank of the stream are a number of bananatrees i have often seen a score or two of young people making a merry foray on the great golden clusters and bearing them off one after another to different parts of the vale shouting and trampling as they went no churlish old curmudgeon could have been the owner of that grove of breadfruit trees or of these gloriously yellow bunches of bananasfrom what i have said it will be perceived that there is a vast difference between 'personal property' and 'real estate' in the valley of typee some individuals of course are more wealthy than others for example the ridgepole of marheyo's house bends under the weight of many a huge packet of tappa his long couch is laid with mats placed one upon the other seven deep outside tinor has ranged along in her bamboo cupboardor whatever the place may be calleda goodly array of calabashes and wooden trenchers now the house just beyond the grove and next to marheyo's occupied by ruaruga is not quite so well furnished there are only three moderatesized packages swinging overhead there are only two layers of mats beneath and the calabashes and trenchers are not so numerous nor so tastefully stained and carved but then ruaruga has a housenot so pretty a one to be surebut just as commodious as marheyo's and i suppose if he wished to vie with his neighbour's establishment he could do so with very little trouble these in short constituted the chief differences perceivable in the relative wealth of the people in typeecivilization does not engross all the virtues of humanity she has not even her full share of them they flourish in greater abundance and attain greater strength among many barbarous people the hospitality of the wild arab the courage of the north american indian and the faithful friendship of some of the polynesian nations far surpass anything of a similar kind among the polished communities of europe if truth and justice and the better principles of our nature cannot exist unless enforced by the statutebook how are we to account for the social condition of the typees so pure and upright were they in all the relations of life that entering their valley as i did under the most erroneous impressions of their character i was soon led to exclaim in amazement 'are these the ferocious savages the bloodthirsty cannibals of whom i have heard such frightful tales they deal more kindly with each other and are more humane than many who study essays on virtue and benevolence and who repeat every night that beautiful prayer breathed first by the lips of the divine and gentle jesus' i will frankly declare that after passing a few weeks in this valley of the marquesas i formed a higher estimate of human nature than i had ever before entertained but alas since then i have been one of the crew of a manofwar and the pentup wickedness of five hundred men has nearly overturned all my previous theoriesthere was one admirable trait in the general character of the typees which more than anything else secured my admiration it was the unanimity of feeling they displayed on every occasion with them there hardly appeared to be any difference of opinion upon any subject whatever they all thought and acted alike i do not conceive that they could support a debating society for a single night there would be nothing to dispute about and were they to call a convention to take into consideration the state of the tribe its session would be a remarkably short one they showed this spirit of unanimity in every action of life everything was done in concert and good fellowship i will give an instance of this fraternal feelingone day in returning with korykory from my accustomed visit to the ti we passed by a little opening in the grove on one side of which my attendant informed me was that afternoon to be built a dwelling of bamboo at least a hundred of the natives were bringing materials to the ground some carrying in their hands one or two of the canes which were to form the sides others slender rods of the habiscus strung with palmetto leaves for the roof every one contributed something to the work and by the united but easy and even indolent labours of all the entire work was completed before sunset the islanders while employed in erecting this tenement reminded me of a colony of beavers at work to be sure they were hardly as silent and demure as those wonderful creatures nor were they by any means as diligent to tell the truth they were somewhat inclined to be lazy but a perfect tumult of hilarity prevailed and they worked together so unitedly and seemed actuated by such an instinct of friendliness that it was truly beautiful to beholdnot a single female took part in this employment and if the degree of consideration in which the everadorable sex is held by the men beas the philosophers affirma just criterion of the degree of refinement among a people then i may truly pronounce the typees to be as polished a community as ever the sun shone upon the religious restrictions of the taboo alone excepted the women of the valley were allowed every possible indulgence nowhere are the ladies more assiduously courted nowhere are they better appreciated as the contributors to our highest enjoyments and nowhere are they more sensible of their power far different from their condition among many rude nations where the women are made to perform all the work while their ungallant lords and masters lie buried in sloth the gentle sex in the valley of typee were exempt from toil if toil it might be called that even in the tropical climate never distilled one drop of perspiration their light household occupations together with the manufacture of tappa the platting of mats and the polishing of drinkingvessels were the only employments pertaining to the women and even these resembled those pleasant avocations which fill up the elegant morning leisure of our fashionable ladies at home but in these occupations slight and agreeable though they were the giddy young girls very seldom engaged indeed these wilful carekilling damsels were averse to all useful employmentlike so many spoiled beauties they ranged through the grovesbathed in the streamdancedflirtedplayed all manner of mischievous pranks and passed their days in one merry round of thoughtless happinessduring my whole stay on the island i never witnessed a single quarrel nor anything that in the slightest degree approached even to a dispute the natives appeared to form one household whose members were bound together by the ties of strong affection the love of kindred i did not so much perceive for it seemed blended in the general love and where all were treated as brothers and sisters it was hard to tell who were actually related to each other by bloodlet it not be supposed that i have overdrawn this picture i have not done so nor let it be urged that the hostility of this tribe to foreigners and the hereditary feuds they carry on against their fellowislanders beyond the mountains are facts which contradict me not so these apparent discrepancies are easily reconciled by many a legendary tale of violence and wrong as well as by events which have passed before their eyes these people have been taught to look upon white men with abhorrence the cruel invasion of their country by porter has alone furnished them with ample provocation and i can sympathize in the spirit which prompts the typee warrior to guard all the passes to his valley with the point of his levelled spear and standing upon the beach with his back turned upon his green home to hold at bay the intruding europeanas to the origin of the enmity of this particular clan towards the neighbouring tribes i cannot so confidently speak i will not say that their foes are the aggressors nor will i endeavour to palliate their conduct but surely if our evil passions must find vent it is far better to expend them on strangers and aliens than in the bosom of the community in which we dwell in many polished countries civil contentions as well as domestic enmities are prevalent and the same time that the most atrocious foreign wars are waged how much less guilty then are our islanders who of these three sins are only chargeable with one and that the least criminalthe reader will ere long have reason to suspect that the typees are not free from the guilt of cannibalism and he will then perhaps charge me with admiring a people against whom so odious a crime is chargeable but this only enormity in their character is not half so horrible as it is usually described according to the popular fictions the crews of vessels shipwrecked on some barbarous coast are eaten alive like so many dainty joints by the uncivil inhabitants and unfortunate voyagers are lured into smiling and treacherous bays knocked on the head with outlandish warclubs and served up without any prelimary dressing in truth so horrific and improbable are these accounts that many sensible and wellinformed people will not believe that any cannibals exist and place every book of voyages which purports to give any account of them on the same shelf with blue beard and jack the giantkiller while others implicitly crediting the most extravagant fictions firmly believe that there are people in the world with tastes so depraved that they would infinitely prefer a single mouthful of material humanity to a good dinner of roast beef and plum pudding but here truth who loves to be centrally located is again found between the two extremes for cannibalism to a certain moderate extent is practised among several of the primitive tribes in the pacific but it is upon the bodies of slain enemies alone and horrible and fearful as the custom is immeasurably as it is to be abhorred and condemned still i assert that those who indulge in it are in other respects humane and virtuous

Warlord of Mars (Chap.11),Edgar Rice Burroughs,warlord of mars chap lyricsthe pit of plentyi did not languish long within the prison of salensus oll during the short time that i lay there fettered with chains of gold i often wondered as to the fate of thuvan dihn jeddak of ptarthmy brave companion had followed me into the garden as i attacked thurid and when salensus oll had left with dejah thoris and the others leaving thuvia of ptarth behind he too had remained in the garden with his daughter apparently unnoticed for he was appareled similarly to the guardsthe last i had seen of him he stood waiting for the warriors who escorted me to close the gate behind them that he might be alone with thuvia could it be possible that they had escaped i doubted it and yet with all my heart i hoped that it might be truethe third day of my incarceration brought a dozen warriors to escort me to the audience chamber where salensus oll himself was to try me a great number of nobles crowded the room and among them i saw thurid but matai shang was not theredejah thoris as radiantly beautiful as ever sat upon a small throne beside salensus oll the expression of sad hopelessness upon her dear face cut deep into my hearther position beside the jeddak of jeddaks boded ill for her and me and on the instant that i saw her there there sprang to my mind the firm intention never to leave that chamber alive if i must leave her in the clutches of this powerful tyranti had killed better men than salensus oll and killed them with my bare hands and now i swore to myself that i should kill him if i found that the only way to save the princess of helium that it would mean almost instant death for me i cared not except that it would remove me from further efforts in behalf of dejah thoris and for this reason alone i would have chosen another way for even though i should kill salensus oll that act would not restore my beloved wife to her own people i determined to wait the final outcome of the trial that i might learn all that i could of the okarian ruler's intentions and then act accordinglyscarcely had i come before him than salensus oll summoned thurid alsodator thurid he said you have made a strange request of me but in accordance with your wishes and your promise that it will result only to my interests i have decided to accedeyou tell me that a certain announcement will be the means of convicting this prisoner and at the same time open the way to the gratification of my dearest wishthurid noddedthen shall i make the announcement here before all my nobles continued salensus oll for a year no queen has sat upon the throne beside me and now it suits me to take to wife one who is reputed the most beautiful woman upon barsoom a statement which none may truthfully denynobles of okar unsheathe your swords and do homage to dejah thoris princess of helium and future queen of okar for at the end of the allotted ten days she shall become the wife of salensus ollas the nobles drew their blades and lifted them on high in accordance with the ancient custom of okar when a jeddak announces his intention to wed dejah thoris sprang to her feet and raising her hand aloft cried in a loud voice that they desisti may not be the wife of salensus oll she pleaded for already i be a wife and mother john carter prince of helium still lives i know it to be true for i overheard matai shang tell his daughter phaidor that he had seen him in kaor at the court of kulan tith jeddak a jeddak does not wed a married woman nor will salensus oll thus violate the bonds of matrimonysalensus oll turned upon thurid with an ugly lookis this the surprise you held in store for me he cried you assured me that no obstacle which might not be easily overcome stood between me and this woman and now i find that the one insuperable obstacle intervenes what mean you man what have you to sayand should i deliver john carter into your hands salensus oll would you not feel that i had more than satisfied the promise that i made you answered thuridtalk not like a fool cried the enraged jeddak i am no child to be thus played withi am talking only as a man who knows replied thurid knows that he can do all that he claimsthen turn john carter over to me within ten days or yourself suffer the end that i should mete out to him were he in my power snapped the jeddak of jeddaks with an ugly scowlyou need not wait ten days salensus oll replied thurid and then turning suddenly upon me as he extended a pointing finger he cried there stands john carter prince of heliumfool shrieked salensus oll fool john carter is a white man this fellow be as yellow as myself john carter's face is smoothmatai shang has described him to me this prisoner has a beard and mustache as large and black as any in okar quick guardsmen to the pits with the black maniac who wishes to throw his life away for a poor joke upon your rulerhold cried thurid and springing forward before i could guess his intention he had grasped my beard and ripped the whole false fabric from my face and head revealing my smooth tanned skin beneath and my closecropped black hairinstantly pandemonium reigned in the audience chamber of salensus oll warriors pressed forward with drawn blades thinking that i might be contemplating the assassination of the jeddak of jeddaks while others out of curiosity to see one whose name was familiar from pole to pole crowded behind their fellowsas my identity was revealed i saw dejah thoris spring to her feetamazement writ large upon her faceand then through that jam of armed men she forced her way before any could prevent a moment only and she was before me with outstretched arms and eyes filled with the light of her great lovejohn carter john carter she cried as i folded her to my breast and then of a sudden i knew why she had denied me in the garden beneath the towerwhat a fool i had been expecting that she would penetrate the marvelous disguise that had been wrought for me by the barber of marentina she had not known me that was all and when she saw the sign of love from a stranger she was offended and righteously indignant indeed but i had been a fooland it was you she cried who spoke to me from the tower how could i dream that my beloved virginian lay behind that fierce beard and that yellow skinshe had been wont to call me her virginian as a term of endearment for she knew that i loved the sound of that beautiful name made a thousand times more beautiful and hallowed by her dear lips and as i heard it again after all those long years my eyes became dimmed with tears and my voice choked with emotionbut an instant did i crush that dear form to me ere salensus oll trembling with rage and jealousy shouldered his way to usseize the man he cried to his warriors and a hundred ruthless hands tore us apartwell it was for the nobles of the court of okar that john carter had been disarmed as it was a dozen of them felt the weight of my clenched fists and i had fought my way half up the steps before the throne to which salensus oll had carried dejah thoris ere ever they could stop methen i went down fighting beneath a halfhundred warriors but before they had battered me into unconsciousness i heard that from the lips of dejah thoris that made all my suffering well worth whilestanding there beside the great tyrant who clutched her by the arm she pointed to where i fought alone against such awful oddsthink you salensus oll that the wife of such as he is she cried would ever dishonor his memory were he a thousand times dead by mating with a lesser mortal lives there upon any world such another as john carter prince of helium lives there another man who could fight his way back and forth across a warlike planet facing savage beasts and hordes of savage men for the love of a womani dejah thoris princess of helium am his he fought for me and won me if you be a brave man you will honor the bravery that is his and you will not kill him make him a slave if you will salensus oll but spare his life i would rather be a slave with such as he than be queen of okarneither slave nor queen dictates to salensus oll replied the jeddak of jeddaks john carter shall die a natural death in the pit of plenty and the day he dies dejah thoris shall become my queeni did not hear her reply for it was then that a blow upon my head brought unconsciousness and when i recovered my senses only a handful of guardsmen remained in the audience chamber with me as i opened my eyes they goaded me with the points of their swords and bade me risethen they led me through long corridors to a court far toward the center of the palacein the center of the court was a deep pit near the edge of which stood half a dozen other guardsmen awaiting me one of them carried a long rope in his hands which he commenced to make ready as we approachedwe had come to within fifty feet of these men when i felt a sudden strange and rapid pricking sensation in one of my fingersfor a moment i was nonplused by the odd feeling and then there came to me recollection of that which in the stress of my adventure i had entirely forgottenthe gift ring of prince talu of marentinainstantly i looked toward the group we were nearing at the same time raising my left hand to my forehead that the ring might be visible to one who sought it simultaneously one of the waiting warriors raised his left hand ostensibly to brush back his hair and upon one of his fingers i saw the duplicate of my own ringa quick look of intelligence passed between us after which i kept my eyes turned away from the warrior and did not look at him again for fear that i might arouse the suspicion of the okarians when we reached the edge of the pit i saw that it was very deep and presently i realized i was soon to judge just how far it extended below the surface of the court for he who held the rope passed it about my body in such a way that it could be released from above at any time and then as all the warriors grasped it he pushed me forward and i fell into the yawning abyssafter the first jerk as i reached the end of the rope that had been paid out to let me fall below the pit's edge they lowered me quickly but smoothly the moment before the plunge while two or three of the men had been assisting in adjusting the rope about me one of them had brought his mouth close to my cheek and in the brief interval before i was cast into the forbidding hole he breathed a single word into my earcouragethe pit which my imagination had pictured as bottomless proved to be not more than a hundred feet in depth but as its walls were smoothly polished it might as well have been a thousand feet for i could never hope to escape without outside assistancefor a day i was left in darkness and then quite suddenly a brilliant light illumined my strange cell i was reasonably hungry and thirsty by this time not having tasted food or drink since the day prior to my incarcerationto my amazement i found the sides of the pit that i had thought smooth lined with shelves upon which were the most delicious viands and liquid refreshments that okar affordedwith an exclamation of delight i sprang forward to partake of some of the welcome food but ere ever i reached it the light was extinguished and though i groped my way about the chamber my hands came in contact with nothing beside the smooth hard wall that i had felt on my first examination of my prisonimmediately the pangs of hunger and thirst began to assail me where before i had had but a mild craving for food and drink i now actually suffered for want of it and all because of the tantalizing sight that i had had of food almost within my grasponce more darkness and silence enveloped me a silence that was broken only by a single mocking laughfor another day nothing occurred to break the monotony of my imprisonment or relieve the suffering superinduced by hunger and thirst slowly the pangs became less keen as suffering deadened the activity of certain nerves and then the light flashed on once again and before me stood an array of new and tempting dishes with great bottles of clear water and flagons of refreshing wine upon the outside of which the cold sweat of condensation stoodagain with the hunger madness of a wild beast i sprang forward to seize those tempting dishes but as before the light went out and i came to a sudden stop against a hard wallthen the mocking laugh rang out for a second timethe pit of plentyah what a cruel mind must have devised this exquisite hellish torture day after day was the thing repeated until i was on the verge of madness and then as i had done in the pits of the warhoons i took a new firm hold upon my reason and forced it back into the channels of sanityby sheer willpower i regained control over my tottering mentality and so successful was i that the next time that the light came i sat quite still and looked indifferently at the fresh and tempting food almost within my reach glad i was that i had done so for it gave me an opportunity to solve the seeming mystery of those vanishing banquetsas i made no move to reach the food the torturers left the light turned on in the hope that at last i could refrain no longer from giving them the delicious thrill of enjoyment that my former futile efforts to obtain it had causedand as i sat scrutinizing the laden shelves i presently saw how the thing was accomplished and so simple was it that i wondered i had not guessed it before the wall of my prison was of clearest glassbehind the glass were the tantalizing viandsafter nearly an hour the light went out but this time there was no mocking laughterat least not upon the part of my tormentors but i to be at quits with them gave a low laugh that none might mistake for the cackle of a maniacnine days passed and i was weak from hunger and thirst but no longer sufferingi was past that then down through the darkness above a little parcel fell to the floor at my sideindifferently i groped for it thinking it but some new invention of my jailers to add to my sufferingsat last i found ita tiny package wrapped in paper at the end of a strong and slender cord as i opened it a few lozenges fell to the floor as i gathered them up feeling of them and smelling of them i discovered that they were tablets of concentrated food such as are quite common in all parts of barsoompoison i thoughtwell what of it why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few more wretched days in this dark pit slowly i raised one of the little pellets to my lipsgoodbye my dejah thoris i breathed i have lived for you and fought for you and now my next dearest wish is to be realized for i shall die for you and taking the morsel in my mouth i devoured itone by one i ate them all nor ever did anything taste better than those tiny bits of nourishment within which i knew must lie the seeds of deathpossibly of some hideous torturing deathas i sat quietly upon the floor of my prison waiting for the end my fingers by accident came in contact with the bit of paper in which the things had been wrapped and as i idly played with it my mind roaming far back into the past that i might live again for a few brief moments before i died some of the many happy moments of a long and happy life i became aware of strange protuberances upon the smooth surface of the parchmentlike substance in my handsfor a time they carried no special significance to my mindi merely was mildly wondrous that they were there but at last they seemed to take form and then i realized that there was but a single line of them like writingnow more interestedly my fingers traced and retraced them there were four separate and distinct combinations of raised lines could it be that these were four words and that they were intended to carry a message to methe more i thought of it the more excited i became until my fingers raced madly back and forth over those bewildering little hills and valleys upon that bit of paperbut i could make nothing of them and at last i decided that my very haste was preventing me from solving the mystery then i took it more slowly again and again my forefinger traced the first of those four combinationsmartian writing is rather difficult to explain to an earth manit is something of a cross between shorthand and picturewriting and is an entirely different language from the spoken language of marsupon barsoom there is but a single oral languageit is spoken today by every race and nation just as it was at the beginning of human life upon barsoom it has grown with the growth of the planet's learning and scientific achievements but so ingenious a thing it is that new words to express new thoughts or describe new conditions or discoveries form themselvesno other word could explain the thing that a new word is required for other than the word that naturally falls to it and so no matter how far removed two nations or races their spoken languages are identicalnot so their written languages however no two nations have the same written language and often cities of the same nation have a written language that differs greatly from that of the nation to which they belongthus it was that the signs upon the paper if in reality they were words baffled me for some time but at last i made out the first oneit was courage and it was written in the letters of marentinacouragethat was the word the yellow guardsman had whispered in my ear as i stood upon the verge of the pit of plentythe message must be from him and he i knew was a friendwith renewed hope i bent my every energy to the deciphering of the balance of the message and at last success rewarded my endeavori had read the four wordscourage follow the rope

Ilias - Kapitel 27,Homer,ilias  kapitel  lyrics heil dir peleid' es mangelt uns nicht des gemeinsamen mahles weder dort im gezelt um atreus' sohn agamemnon noch auch jetzo allhier denn genug des erfreuenden stehet hier zum schmaus doch nicht nach lieblichem mahle verlangt uns sondern das groe weh du gttlicher ringsum schauend zagen wir jetzo gilt's ob errettet sind oder verloren uns die gebogenen schiffe wo du nicht mit strke dich grtest nahe den schiffen bereits und der mauer drohn sie gelagert trojas mutige shn' und die fernberufenen helfer ringsum feuer entflammend durchs heer und es hemme sie trotzt man nichts annoch sich hinein in die dunkelen schiffe zu strzen ihnen gewhrt auch zeus rechtshin erscheinende zeichen seines strahls doch hektor die funkelnden augen voll mordlust wtet daher und vertrauend dem donnerer achtet er nichts mehr weder menschen noch gott so treibt ihn der taumel des wahnsinns sehnlich wnscht er da bald der heilige morgen erscheine denn er verheit von den schiffen zu haun die prangenden schnbel sie dann selbst zu verbrennen in strmender flamm' und zu morden argos' shn' um die schiffe betubt im dampfe des brandes doch nun sorg' ich im herzen und frchte mich da ihm die drohung ganz vollenden die gtter und uns das schicksal verhngt sei hinzusterben in troja entfernt von der fruchtbaren argos aber wohlauf wenn das herz dir gebeut die mnner achaias jetzt auch spt zu befrein aus der drngenden troer getmmel siehe dich selbst hinfort bekmmert es aber umsonst ja sucht man geschehenem bel noch besserung lieber zuvor nun sinn' umher wie du wendest den schrecklichen tag der achaier ach mein freund wie sehr ermahnte dich peleus der vater jenes tags da aus phtia zu atreus' sohn er dich sandte lieber sohn siegsstrke wird dir athena und here geben wenn's ihnen gefllt nur bndige du dein erhabnes stolzes herz in der brust denn freundlicher sinn ist besser meide den bsen zank den verderblichen da dich noch hher ehre das volk der argeier die jnglinge so wie die greise also ermahnte der greis du vergaest es aber auch jetzt noch ruh' und entsage dem zorne dem krnkenden sieh agamemnon beut dir wrdige gaben sobald du dich wendest vom zorne willst du so hre mich an damit ich dir alles erzhle was dir dort im gezelt zur gabe verhie agamemnon zehn talente des goldes dazu dreifiger kessel  sieben vom feuer noch rein und zwanzig schimmernde becken auch zwlf mchtige rosse gekrnt mit preisen des wettlaufs wohl nicht drftig wre der mann dem so vieles geworden und nicht arm an schtzen des hochgepriesenen goldes als agamemnons rosse der siegskleinode gewannen sieben weiber auch gibt er untadlige kundig der arbeit lesbische die da du lesbos die blhende selber erobert er sich erkor die an reiz der sterblichen tchter besiegten diese nun gibt er dir es begleite sie die er entfhret brises tochter zugleich und mit heiligem eide beschwrt er's da er nie ihr lager verunehrt noch ihr genahet wie in der menschen geschlecht der mann dem weibe sich nahet dieses empfngst du alles sogleich wenn aber hinfort uns priamos' mchtige stadt die gtter verleihn zu erobern reichlich sollst du dein schiff mit gold und erz belasten selbst einsteigend wenn einst wir danaer teilen den siegsraub auch der troischen weiber erwhle du zwanzig dir selber die nach helena dort der argeierin prangen an schnheit wann zum achaiischen argos dem segenslande wir heimziehn sollst du sein eidam sein und er ehrt dich gleich dem orestes der sein einziger sohn aufblht in freudiger flle drei sind ihm der tchter in wohlverschlossener wohnung deren whle dir eine chrysothemis iphianassa oder laodike auch und fhr' umsonst die erkorne heim in des peleus haus er gibt dir selber noch brautschatz reichlichen mehr als je ein mann der tochter gegeben sieben gibt er dir dort der wohlbevlkerten stdte enope und kardamyle auch und die grasige hire pher die heilige burg und die grnenden aun um antheia auch peia die schn' und pedasos frhlich des weinbaus alle sind nah' am meere begrenzt von der sandigen pylos und es bewohnen sie mnner an schafen reich und an rindern welche hoch mit geschenk wie einen gott dich verehrten und dein scepter gehorchend dir steuerten reichliche schatzung dieses vollendet er dir sobald du dich wendest vom zorne aber wenn atreus' sohn zu sehr dir im herzen verhat ist er und seine geschenk' o so schau der andern achaier drngende not mit erbarmen im heer das wie einen der gtter ehren dich wird denn wahrlich erhabenen ruhm dir gewnnst du hektor entraftest du nun denn nahe dir wagt' er zu kommen voll unsinniger wut da er whnt nicht einer auch gleiche ihm in der danaer volk so viel hertrugen die schiffe ihm antwortete drauf der mutige renner achilleus edler laertiad' erfindungsreicher odysseus sieh ich mu die rede nur grad' und frank dir verweigern so wie im herzen ich denk' und wie's unfehlbar geschehn wird da ihr mir nicht vorjammert von hier und dort mich belagernd denn mir verhat ist jener so sehr wie des ades pforten wer ein andres im herzen verbirgt und ein anderes redet aber ich selbst will sagen wie mir's am heilsamsten dnket weder des atreus' sohn agamemnon soll mich bereden noch die andern achaier dieweil ja nimmer ein dank war stets unverdrossenen kampf mit feindlichen mnnern zu kmpfen gleich ist des bleibenden los und sein der mit eifer gestritten gleicher ehre geniet der feig' und der tapfere krieger gleich auch stirbt der trge dahin und wer vieles getan hat nichts ja frommt es mir selbst da ich sorg' und kummer erduldet stets die seele dem tod' entgegentragend im streite so wie den nackenden vglein im nest herbringet die mutter einen gefundenen bissen wenn ihr auch selber nicht wohl ist also hab' ich genug unruhiger nchte durchwachet auch der blutigen tage genug durchstrebt in der feldschlacht tapfere mnner bestreitend um jenen ein weib zu erobern zwlf schon hab' ich mit schiffen bevlkerte stdte verwstet und elf andre zu fu umher in der scholligen troja dort aus allen erkor ich der kleinode viel und geehrte mir voraus und brachte sie all' agamemnon zur gabe atreus' sohn er ruhend indes bei den rstigen schiffen nahm die schtz' und verteilt' ein weniges vieles behielt er dennoch gab er den helden und knigen ehrengeschenke die noch jeder verwahrt nur mir von allen achaiern nahm er's und hat das reizende weib womit er der wollust pflegen mag was bewog denn zum kriegszug gegen die troer argos' volk was fhrt' er hieher die versammelten streiter atreus' sohn war's nicht der lockigen helena wegen lieben allein denn jene die fraun von den redenden menschen atreus' shn' ein jeglicher mann der edel und weis' ist liebt und pflegt die seine mit zrtlichkeit so wie ich jene auch von herzen geliebt wiewohl mein speer sie erbeutet nun er mir aus den hnden den siegslohn raubte mit arglist nie versuch' er hinfort mich kundigen nimmer ihm trau' ich sondern mit dir odysseus und anderen vlkergebietern sinn' er nach von den schiffen die feindliche glut zu entfernen wahrlich schon sehr vieles vollendet' er ohne mein zutun schon die mauer erbaut' er und leitete drauen den graben breit umher und gro und drinnen auch pflanzet' er pfhle dennoch kann er ja nicht die gewalt des mordenden hektors bndigen aber da ich im danaervolke noch mitzog niemals wagt' es hektor entfernt von der mauer zu kmpfen sondern nur zum skischen tor und der buche gelangt' er wo er einst mich bestand und kaum mir entfloh vor dem angriff nun mir nicht es gefllt mit dem gttlichen hektor zu kmpfen bring' ich morgen ein opfer fr zeus und die anderen gtter wohl dann belad' ich die schiff' und nachdem ich ins meer sie gezogen wirst du schaun so du willst und solcherlei dinge dich kmmern schwimmen im morgenrot auf dem flutenden hellespontos meine schiff' und darin die emsig rudernden mnner und wenn glckliche fahrt der gestaderschttrer gewhret mcht' ich am dritten tag' in die schollige phtia gelangen vieles hab' ich daheim das ich hieher wandernd zurcklie anderes auch von hier des rtlichen erzes und goldes schngegrtete weiber zugleich und grauliches eisen bring' ich durchs los mir beschert doch den siegslohn der ihn gegeben nahm ihn mir selbst hochmtig der vlkerfrst agamemnon atreus' sohn das alles verknd' ihm so wie ich sage ffentlich da auch die andern im volk der achaier ergrimmen wenn er vielleicht noch einen der danaer hofft zu betrgen jener in unverschmtheit gehllete schwerlich indes mir wagt er hinfort auch frech wie ein hund ins antlitz zu schauen nimmer ihm werd' ich zu rat mich vereinigen nimmer zu taten einmal betrog er mich nun und frevelte nimmer hinfort wohl tuscht sein tckisches wort er begnge sich sondern geruhig wandr' er dahin denn ihm raubte der waltende zeus die besinnung greul sind mir seine geschenk' und ich acht' ihn selber nicht so viel nein und bt' er mir zehnmal und zwanzigmal grere gter als was jetzo er hat und was er vielleicht noch erwartet bt' er sogar die gter orchomenos oder was thebe hegt gyptos stadt wo reich sind die huser an schtzen hundert hat sie der tor' und es ziehn zweihundert aus jedem rstige mnner zum streit mit rossen daher und geschirren bt' er mir auch so viel wie des sandes am meer und des staubes dennoch nimmer hinfort bewegte mein herz agamemnon eh' er mir ausgebt die seelenkrnkende schmhung keine tochter begehr' ich von atreus' sohn agamemnon trotzte sie auch an reiz der goldenen aphrodite wre sie klug wie pallas athen' an knstlicher arbeit dennoch begehr' ich sie nicht er whle sich sonst der achaier einen der ihm gem und der auch hher an macht ist denn erhalten die gtter mich nur und gelang' ich zur heimat dann wird peleus selbst ein edeles weib mir vermhlen viel der achaierinnen sind rings in hellas und phtia tchter erhabener frsten die stdt' und lnder beherrschen hievon die mir gefllt erwhl' ich zur trauten gemahlin dort auch trachtet mir oft des mutigen herzens verlangen einer ehegenossin vermhlt in geflliger eintracht mich der gter zu freun die peleus der greis sich gesammelt nichts sind gegen das leben die schtze mir nichts was vordem auch ilios barg wie man sagt die stadt voll prangender huser einst als blhte der fried' eh' die macht der achaier daherkam noch was die steinerne schwelle des treffenden drinnen bewahret phbos apollons schatz in pythos klippichten feldern beutet man doch im kriege gemstete rinder und schafe und gewinnt dreif' und braungemhnete rosse aber des menschen geist kehrt niemals weder erbeutet noch erlangt nachdem er des sterbenden lippen entflohn ist meine gttliche mutter die silberfige thetis sagt mich fhre zum tod' ein zweifach endendes schicksal wenn ich allhier verharrend die stadt der troer umkmpfe hin sei die heimkehr dann doch blhe mir ewiger nachruhm aber wenn heim ich kehre zum lieben lande der vter dann sei verwelkt mein ruhm doch weithin reiche des lebens dauer und nicht frhzeitig ans ziel des todes gelang' ich auch den brigen mcht' ich ein ratsames wort zureden heim in den schiffen zu gehn nie findet ihr doch der erhabnen ilios untergang denn der waltende zeus kronion deckt sie mit schirmender hand und mutvoll trotzen die vlker aber ihr nun geht den edelen frsten achaias botschaft anzusagen das ehrenamt der geehrten da sie anderen rat und besseren jetzo ersinnen welcher die schiff' errette zugleich und das volk der achaier bei den gerumigen schiffen denn nicht ist jener gedeihlich welchen sie jetzt ausdachten da ich im zorne beharre phnix indes mag bleibend bei uns zur ruhe sich legen da er mit mir heimschiffe zum lieben lande der vter morgen wenn's ihm gefllt denn nicht aus zwang soll er mitgehn

only copies have beenprinted and type afterwarddistributedvenus in fursbyleopold von sachermasochtranslated from the germanbyfernanda savage_but the almighty lord hath struck himand hath delivered him into the hands ofa woman_the vulgate judith xvi my company was charmingopposite me by the massive renaissance fireplace sat venus she was not a casual woman of the halfworld who under this pseudonym wages war against the enemy sex like mademoiselle cleopatra but the real true goddess of loveshe sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire whosereflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm themher head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes it was all i could see of her she had wrapped her marblelike body in a huge fur and rolled herself up trembling like a cati don't understand it i exclaimed it isn't really cold anylonger for two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather you must be nervousmuch obliged for your spring she replied with a low stony voice and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely twice in succession i really can't stand it here much longer and i am beginning to understandwhat dear ladyi am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the ununderstandable all of a sudden i understand the germanic virtue of woman and german philosophy and i am no longer surprised that you of the north do not know how to love haven't even an idea of what love isbut madame i replied flaring up i surely haven't given you any reasonoh you the divinity sneezed for the third time and shrugged her shoulders with inimitable grace that's why i have always been nice to you and even come to see you now and then although i catch a cold every time in spite of all my furs do you remember the first time we methow could i forget it i said you wore your abundant hair inbrown curls and you had brown eyes and a red mouth but i recognized you immediately by the outline of your face and its marblelike palloryou always wore a violetblue velvet jacket edged with squirrelskinyou were really in love with the costume and awfully docileyou have taught me what love is your serene form of worship let me forget two thousand yearsand my faithfulness to you was without equalwell as far as faithfulness goesungratefuli will not reproach you with anything you are a divine woman but nevertheless a woman and like every woman cruel in lovewhat you call cruel the goddess of love replied eagerly issimply the element of passion and of natural love which is woman's nature and makes her give herself where she loves and makes her love everything that pleases hercan there be any greater cruelty for a lover than theunfaithfulness of the woman he lovesindeed she replied we are faithful as long as we love but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love and the giving of herself without enjoyment who is cruel therewoman or man you ofthe north in general take love too soberly and seriously you talkof duties where there should be only a question of pleasurethat is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous and ourrelations permanentand yet a restless always unsatisfied craving for the nudity ofpaganism she interrupted but that love which is the highest joywhich is divine simplicity itself is not for you moderns youchildren of reflection it works only evil in you _as soon as youwish to be natural you become common_ to you nature seems somethinghostile you have made devils out of the smiling gods of greece andout of me a demon you can only exorcise and curse me or slayyourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar and if ever one ofyou has had the courage to kiss my red mouth he makes a barefootpilgrimage to rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to growfrom his withered staff while under my feet roses violets andmyrtles spring up every hour but their fragrance does not agree withyou stay among your northern fogs and christian incense let uspagans remain under the debris beneath the lava do not disinter uspompeii was not built for you nor our villas our baths our templesyou do not require gods we are chilled in your worldthe beautiful marble woman coughed and drew the dark sables stillcloser about her shouldersmuch obliged for the classical lesson i replied but you cannotdeny that man and woman are mortal enemies in your serene sunlitworld as well as in our foggy one in love there is union into asingle being for a short time only capable of only one thought onesensation one will in order to be then further disunited and youknow this better than i whichever of the two fails to subjugate willsoon feel the feet of the other on his neckand as a rule the man that of the woman cried madame venus withproud mockery which you know better than iof course and that is why i don't have any illusionsyou mean you are now my slave without illusions and for thatreason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercymadamedon't you know me yet yes i am _cruel_since you take so muchdelight in that wordand am i not entitled to be so man is the onewho desires woman the one who is desired this is woman's entire butdecisive advantage through his passion nature has given man intowoman's hands and the woman who does not know how to make him hersubject her slave her toy and how to betray him with a smile in theend is not wiseexactly your principles i interrupted angrilythey are based on the experience of thousands of years shereplied ironically while her white fingers played over the dark furthe more devoted a woman shows herself the sooner the man sobersdown and becomes domineering the more cruelly she treats him and themore faithless she is the worse she uses him the more wantonly sheplays with him the less pity she shows him by so much the more willshe increase his desire be loved worshipped by him so it hasalways been since the time of helen and delilah down to catherinethe second and lola montezi cannot deny i said that nothing will attract a man more thanthe picture of a beautiful passionate cruel and despotic woman whowantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with herwhimand in addition wears furs exclaimed the divinitywhat do you mean by thati know your predilectiondo you know i interrupted that since we last saw each otheryou have grown very coquettishin what way may i askin that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greateradvantage than by these dark furs and thatthe divinity laughedyou are dreaming she cried wake up and she clasped my armwith her marblewhite hand do wake up she repeated raucously withthe low register of her voice i opened my eyes with difficultyi saw the hand which shook me and suddenly it was brown as bronzethe voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant whostood before me at his full height of nearly six feetdo get up continued the good fellow it is really disgracefulwhat is disgracefulto fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides he snuffedthe candles which had burned down and picked up the volume which hadfallen from my hand with a book byhe looked at the title pageby hegel besides it is high time you were starting for mrseverin's who is expecting us for teaa curious dream said severin when i had finished he supportedhis arms on his knees resting his face in his delicate finelyveined hands and fell to ponderingi knew that he wouldn't move for a long time hardly even breathe thisactually happened but i didn't consider his behavior as in any wayremarkable i had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearlythree years and gotten used to his peculiarities for it cannot bedenied that he was peculiar although he wasn't quite the dangerousmadman that the neighborhood or indeed the entire district of kolomeaconsidered him to be i found his personality not only interestingandthat is why many also regarded me a bit madbut to a degreesympathetic for a galician nobleman and landowner and considering hisagehe was hardly over thirtyhe displayed surprising sobriety acertain seriousness even pedantry he lived according to a minutelyelaborated halfphilosophical halfpractical system like clockworknot this alone but also by the thermometer barometer aerometerhydrometer hippocrates hufeland plato kant knigge and lordchesterfield but at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion andgave the impression of being about to run with his head right through awall at such times every one preferred to get out of his waywhile he remained silent the fire sang in the chimney and the largevenerable samovar sang and the ancient chair in which i sat rockingto and fro smoking my cigar and the cricket in the old walls sangtoo i let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus skeletons ofanimals stuffed birds globes plastercasts with which his roomwas heaped full until by chance my glance remained fixed on apicture which i had seen often enough before but today under thereflected red glow of the fire it made an indescribable impressionon meit was a large oil painting done in the robust fullbodied mannerof the belgian school its subject was strange enougha beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face with abundanthair tied into a classical knot on which white powder lay like asoft hoarfrost was resting on an ottoman supported on her left armshe was nude in her dark furs her right hand played with a lashwhile her bare foot rested carelessly on a man lying before her likea slave like a dog in the sharply outlined but wellformedlinaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionatedevotion he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of amartyr this man the footstool for her feet was severin butbeardless and it seemed some ten years younger_venus in furs_ i cried pointing to the picture that is the wayi saw her in my dreami too said severin only i dreamed my dream with open eyesindeedit is a tiresome storyyour picture apparently suggested my dream i continued but dotell me what it means i can imagine that it played a role in yourlife and perhaps a very decisive one but the details i can only getfrom youlook at its counterpart replied my strange friend withoutheeding my questionthe counterpart was an excellent copy of titian's wellknown venuswith the mirror in the dresden galleryand what is the significanceseverin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with whichtitian garbed his goddess of loveit too is a 'venus in furs' he said with a slight smile idon't believe that the old venetian had any secondary intention hesimply painted the portrait of some aristocratic mesalina and wastactful enough to let cupid hold the mirror in which she tests hermajestic allure with cold satisfaction he looks as though his taskwere becoming burdensome enough the picture is painted flatterylater an 'expert' in the rococo period baptized the lady with thename of venus the furs of the despot in which titian's fair modelwrapped herself probably more for fear of a cold than out ofmodesty have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty thatconstitute woman's essence and her beautybut enough of that the picture as it now exists is a bittersatire on our love venus in this abstract north in this icychristian world has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catchcoldseverin laughed and lighted a fresh cigarettejust then the door opened and an attractive stoutish blonde girlentered she had wise kindly eyes was dressed in black silk andbrought us cold meat and eggs with our tea severin took one of thelatter and decapitated it with his knifedidn't i tell you that i want them softboiled he cried with aviolence that made the young woman tremblebut my dear sevtchu she said timidlysevtchu nothing he yelled you are to obey obey do youunderstand and he tore the _kantchuk_  which was hanging beside the weapons from its hookthe woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doejust wait i'll get you yet he called after herbut severin i said placing my hand on his arm how can you treata pretty young woman thuslook at the woman he replied blinking humorously with his eyeshad i flattered her she would have cast the noose around my neckbut now when i bring her up with the _kantchuk_ she adores menonsensenonsense nothing that is the way you have to break in womenwell if you like it live like a pasha in your harem but don'tlay down theories for mewhy not he said animatedly goethe's 'you must be hammer or anvil'is absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and womandidn't lady venus in your dream prove that to you woman's power liesin man's passion and she knows how to use it if man doesn'tunderstand himself he has only one choice to be the _tyrant_ over orthe _slave_ of woman as soon as he gives in his neck is under theyoke and the lash will soon fall upon himstrange maximsnot maxims but experiences he replied nodding his head _i haveactually felt the lash_ i am cured do you care to know howhe rose and got a small manuscript from his massive desk and putit in front of meyou have already asked about the picture i have long owed you anexplanation herereadseverin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me and seemedto dream with open eyes silence had fallen again and again the firesang in the chimney and the samovar and the cricket in the oldwalls i opened the manuscript and readconfessions of a supersensual manthe margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the wellknownlines from _faust_thou supersensual sensual wooera woman leads you by the nosemephistophelesi turned the titlepage and read what follows has been compiledfrom my diary of that period because it is impossible ever franklyto write of

smileinvoluntarily even laugh aloud as i am writing down my adventuresyet i am not writing with ordinary ink but with red blood that dripsfrom my heart all its wounds long scarred over have opened and

all is that i don't do much more than to stretch thecanvas smooth the bow line the scores for i amno false modestyfriend severin you can lie to others but you don't quite succeed anylonger in lying to yourselfi am nothing but a dilettante a dilettantein painting in poetry in music and several other of the socalledunprofitable arts which however at present secure for their mastersthe income of a cabinet minister or even that of a minor potentateabove all else i am a dilettante in lifeup to the present i have lived as i have painted and written poetryi never got far beyond the preparation the plan the first act thefirst stanza there are people like that who begin everything andnever finish anything i am such a onebut what am i sayingto the business in handi lie in my window and the miserable little town which fills mewith despondency really seems infinitely full of poetry howwonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwovenwith golden sunlight mountaintorrents weave through them likeribbons of silver how clear and blue the heavens into whichsnowcapped crags project how green and fresh the forested slopesthe meadows on which small herds graze down to the yellow billowsof grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up againthe house in which i live stands in a sort of park or forest orwilderness whatever one wants to call it and is very solitaryits sole inhabitants are myself a widow from lemberg and madametartakovska who runs the house a little old woman who grows olderand smaller each day there are also an old dog that limps on oneleg and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn thisball of yarn i believe belongs to the widowshe is said to be really beautiful this widow still very youngtwentyfour at the most and very rich she dwells in the first storyand i on the ground floor she always keeps the green blinds drawn andhas a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbingplants i for mypart down below have a comfortable intimate arbor of honeysuckle inwhich i read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs ican look up on the balcony sometimes i actually do so and then fromtime to time a white gown gleams between the dense green networkreally the beautiful woman up there doesn't interest me very much for iam in love with someone else and terribly unhappy at that far moreunhappy than the knight of toggenburg or the chevalier in manonl'escault because the object of my adoration is of stonein the garden in the tiny wilderness there is a graceful littlemeadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully on this meadow isa stone statue of venus the original of which i believe is inflorence this venus is the most beautiful woman i have ever seen inall my lifethat however does not signify much for i have seen few beautifulwomen or rather few women at all in love too i am a dilettante whonever got beyond the preparation the first actbut why talk in superlatives as if something that is beautifulcould be surpassedit is sufficient to say that this venus is beautiful i love herpassionately with a morbid intensity madly as one can only love awoman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternallyuniform eternally calm stony smile i literally adore heri often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch whenthe sun broods over the forest often i visit that cold cruelmistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her with theface pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest andmy prayers go up to herthe rising moon which just now is waning produces an indescribableeffect it seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadowin its gleam of silver the goddess stands as if transfigured andseems to bathe in the soft moonlightonce when i was returning from my devotions by one of the walksleading to the house i suddenly saw a woman's figure white asstone under the illumination of the moon and separated from memerely by a screen of trees it seemed as if the beautiful woman ofmarble had taken pity on me become alive and followed me i wasseized by a nameless fear my heart threatened to burst and insteadwell i am a dilettante as always i broke down at the secondstanza rather on the contrary i did not break down but ran awayas fast as my legs would carry me    what an accident through a jew dealing in photographs i secured apicture of my ideal it is a small reproduction of titian's venuswith the mirror what a woman i want to write a poem but insteadi take the reproduction and write on it _venus in furs_you are cold while you yourself fan flames by all means wrapyourself in your despotic furs there is no one to whom they are moreappropriate cruel goddess of love and of beautyafter a while i adda few verses from goethe which i recently found in his paralipomenato _faust_to amorthe pair of wings a fiction arethe arrows they are naught but clawsthe wreath conceals the little hornsfor without any doubt he islike all the gods of ancient greeceonly a devil in disguisethen i put the picture before me on my table supporting it with abook and looked at iti was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear bythe cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charmsin her furs of dark sable by the severity and hardness which lay inthis cold marblelike face again i took my pen in hand and wrotethe following wordsto love to be loved what happiness and yet how the glamour ofthis pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping awoman who makes a plaything out of us of being the slave of abeautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot even samson thehero the giant again put himself into the hands of delilah evenafter she had betrayed him and again she betrayed him and thephilistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very endhe kept fixed drunken with rage and love upon the beautifulbetrayeri was breakfasting in my honeysuckle arbor and reading in the bookof judith i envied the hero holofernes because of the regal womanwho cut off his head with a sword and because of his beautifulsanguinary endthe almighty lord hath struck him and hath delivered him into thehands of a womanthis sentence strangely impressed mehow ungallant these jews are i thought and their god might choosemore becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sexthe almighty lord hath struck him and hath delivered him into thehands of a woman i repeated to myself what shall i do so that hemay punish meheaven preserve us here comes the housekeeper who has againdiminished somewhat in size overnight and up there among the greentwinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again is it venusor the widowthis time it happens to be the widow for madame tartakovska makesa courtesy and asks me in her name for something to read i run tomy room and gather together a couple of volumeslater i remember that my picture of venus is in one of them and nowit and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up theretogether what will she sayi hear her laughis she laughing at meit is full moon it is already peering over the tops of the lowhemlocks that fringe the park a silvery exhalation fills theterrace the groups of trees all the landscape as far as the eyecan reach in the distance it gradually fades away like tremblingwatersi cannot resist i feel a strange urge and call within me i put onmy clothes again and go out into the gardensome power draws me toward the meadow toward her who is mydivinity and my belovedthe night is cool i feel a slight chill the atmosphere is heavywith the odor of flowers and of the forest it intoxicateswhat solemnity what music round about a nightingale sobs thestars quiver very faintly in the paleblue glamour the meadow seemssmooth like a mirror like a covering of ice on a pondthe statue of venus stands out august and luminousbutwhat has happened from the marble shoulders of the goddess alarge dark fur flows down to her heels i stand dumbfounded and stareat her in amazement again an indescribable fear seizes hold of meand i take flighti hasten my steps and notice that i have missed the main path asi am about to turn aside into one of the green walks i see venussitting before me on a stone bench not the beautiful woman ofmarble but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbingpulses she has actually come to life for me like the statue thatbegan to breathe for her creator indeed the miracle is only halfcompleted her white hair seems still to be of stone and her whitegown shimmers like moonlight or is it satin from her shoulders thedark fur flows but her lips are already reddening and her cheeksbegin to take color two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fallupon me and now she laughsher laughter is very mysterious veryi don't know it cannot bedescribed it takes my breath away i flee further and after everyfew steps i have to pause to take breath the mocking laughterpursues me through the dark leafy paths across light open spacesthrough the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce i can nolonger find my way i wander about utterly confused with cold dropsof perspiration on the foreheadfinally i stand still and engage in a short monologueit runswellone is either very polite to one's self or very rudei say to myselfdonkeythis word exercises a remarkable effect like a magic formula whichsets me free and makes me master of myselfi am perfectly quiet in a momentwith considerable pleasure i repeat donkeynow everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes againthere is the fountain there the alley of boxwood there the housewhich i am slowly approachingyetsuddenly the appearance is here again behind the green screenthrough which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered withsilver i again see the white figure the woman of stone whom iadore whom i fear and fleewith a couple of leaps i am within the house and catch my breath andreflectwhat am i really a little dilettante or a great big donkeya sultry morning the atmosphere is dead heavily laden with odorsyet stimulating again i am sitting in my honeysuckle arbor readingin the odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirersinto beasts a wonderful picture of antique lovethere is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of mybook rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustlinga woman's dressshe is therevenusbut without fursno this time it is merelythe widowand yetvenusoh what a womanas she stands there in her light white morning gown looking at me herslight figure seems full of poetry and grace she is neither large norsmall her head is alluring piquantin the sense of the period of thefrench marquisesrather than formally beautiful what enchantment andsoftness what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth herskin is so infinitely delicate that the blue veins show througheverywhere even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom howabundant her red hairit is red not blonde or goldenyellowhowdiabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck now her eyesmeet mine like green lightningsthey are green these eyes of herswhose power is so indescribablegreen but as are precious stones ordeep unfathomable mountain lakesshe observes my confusion which has even made me discourteous for ihave remained seated and still have my cap on my headshe smiles roguishlyfinally i rise and bow to her she comes closer and bursts out intoa loud almost childlike laughter i stammer as only a littledilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasionthus our acquaintance beganthe divinity asks for my name and mentions her ownher name is wanda von dunajewand she is actually my venusbut madame what put the idea into your headthe little picture in one of your booksi had forgotten about itthe curious notes on its backwhy curiousshe looked at mei have always wanted to know a real dreamer some timefor the sakeof the changeand you seem one of the maddest of the tribedear ladyin fact again i fell victim to an odious asininestammering and in addition blushed in a way that might have beenappropriate for a youngster of sixteen but not for me who wasalmost a full ten years olderyou were afraid of me last nightreallyof coursebut won't you sit downshe sat down and enjoyed my embarrassmentfor actually i was evenmore afraid of her now in the full light of day a delightfulexpression of contempt hovered about her upper lipyou look at love and especially woman she began as somethinghostile something against which you put up a defense even ifunsuccessfully you feel that their power over you gives you asensation of pleasurable torture of pungent cruelty this is agenuinely modern point of viewyou don't share iti do not share it she said quickly and decisively shaking herhead so that her curls flew up like red flamesthe ideal which i strive to realize in my life is the serenesensuousness of the greekspleasure without pain i do not believein the kind of love which is preached by christianity by themoderns by the knights of the spirit yes look at me i am worsethan a heretic i am a pagan'doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counselwhen in ida's grove she was pleased with the hero achilles'these lines from goethe's _roman elegy_ have always delighted mein nature there is only the love of the heroic age 'when gods andgoddesses loved' at that time 'desire followed the glance enjoymentdesire' all else is factitious affected a lie christianity whosecruel emblem the cross has always had for me an element of themonstrous brought something alien and hostile into nature and itsinnocent instinctsthe battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modernman i do not care to have a share in ityes mount olympus would be the place for you madame i repliedbut we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity least ofall in love the idea of sharing a woman even if it were an aspasiawith another revolts us we are jealous as is our god for examplewe have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious phrynewe prefer one of holbein's meagre pallid virgins which is whollyours to an antique venus no matter how divinely beautiful she isbut who loves anchises today paris tomorrow adonis the day afterand if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowingpassionate devotion to such a woman her serene joy of life appearsto us as something demonic and cruel and we read into our happinessa sin which we must expiateso you too are one of those who rave about modern women thosemiserable hysterical feminine creatures who don't appreciate a realman in their somnambulistic search for some dreamman and masculineideal amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their christianduties they cheat and are cheated they always seek again and chooseand reject they are never happy and never give happiness theyaccuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love andlive as helen and aspasia lived nature admits of no permanence inthe relation between man and womanbut my dear ladylet me finish it is only man's egoism which wants to keep womanlike some buried treasure all endeavors to introduce permanence inlove the most changeable thing in this changeable human existencehave gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies vows andlegalities can you deny that our christian world has given itselfover to corruptionbutbut you are about to say the individual who rebels against thearrangements of society is ostracized branded stoned so be it iam willing to take the risk my principles are very pagan i willlive my own life as it pleases me i am willing to do without yourhypocritical respect i prefer to be happy the inventors of thechristian marriage have done well simultaneously to inventimmortality i however have no wish to live eternally when withmy last breath everything as far as wanda von dunajew is concernedcomes to an end here below what does it profit me whether my purespirit joins the choirs of angels or whether my dust goes into theformation of new beings shall i belong to one man whom i don't lovemerely because i have once loved him no i do not renounce i loveeveryone who pleases me and give happiness to everyone who loves meis that ugly no it is more beautiful by far than if cruelly ienjoy the tortures which my beauty excites and virtuously rejectthe poor fellow who is pining away for me i am young rich andbeautiful and i live serenely for the sake of pleasure andenjoymentwhile she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly and i had takenhold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them butbeing a genuine dilettante i hastily let go of them againyour frankness i said delights me and not it alonemy confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there werea rope around my neckyou were about to sayi was about to sayi wasi am sorryi interrupted youhow soa long pause she is doubtless engaging in a monologue whichtranslated into my language would be comprised in the single worddonkeyif i may ask i finally began how did you arrive at thesetheseconclusionsquite simply my father was an intelligent man from my cradle onwardi was surrounded by replicas of ancient art at ten years of age iread _gil blas_ at twelve _la pucelle_ where others hadhopo'mythumb bluebeard cinderella as childhood friends minewere venus and apollo hercules and lackoon my husband's personalitywas filled with serenity and sunlight not even the incurable illnesswhich fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his browon the very night of his death he took me in his arms and during themany months when he lay dying in his wheel chair he often saidjokingly to me 'well have you already picked out a lover' i blushedwith shame 'don't deceive me' he added on one occasion 'that wouldseem ugly to me but pick out an attractive lover or preferablyseveral you are a splendid woman but still half a child and youneed toys'i suppose i hardly need tell you that during his life time i hadno lover but it was through him that i have become what i am awoman of greecea goddess i interruptedwhich one she smiledvenusshe threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows perhapseven a 'venus in furs' watch out i have a large very large furwith which i could cover you up entirely and i have a mind to catchyou in it as in a netdo you believe i said quickly for an idea which seemed good inspite of its conventionality and triteness flashed into my head doyou believe that your theories could be carried into execution at thepresent time that venus would be permitted to stray with impunityamong our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty andserenity_undraped_ of course not but in furs she replied smiling wouldyou care to see mineand thenwhat thenbeautiful free serene and happy human beings such as the greekswere are only possible when it is permitted to have _slaves_ who willperform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all elselabor for themof course she replied playfully an olympian divinity such asi am requires a whole army of slaves beware of mewhyi myself was frightened at the hardiness with which i uttered thiswhy it did not startle her in the leastshe drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth becamevisible and then said lightly as if she were discussing sometrifling matter do you want to be my slavethere is no equality in love i replied solemnly whenever it isa matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled it seems muchmore satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman butwhere shall i find the woman who knows how to rule calmly full ofselfconfidence even harshly and not seek to gain her power bymeans of petty naggingoh that might not be so difficultyou thinkifor instance she laughed and leaned far backi have a realtalent for despotismi also have the necessary fursbut last nightyou were really seriously afraid of mequite seriouslyand nownow i am more afraid of you than everwe are together every day i andvenus we are together a greatdeal we breakfast in my honeysuckle arbor and have tea in herlittle sittingroom i have an opportunity to unfold all my smallvery small talents of what use would have been my study of all thevarious sciences my playing at all the arts if i were unable in thecase of a pretty little womanbut this woman is by no means little in fact she impresses metremendously i made a drawing of her today and felt particularlyclearly how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for acameohead like hers the configuration of her face has little of theroman but much of the greeksometimes i should like to paint her as psyche and then again asastarte it depends upon the expression in her eyes whether it isvaguely dreamy or halfconsuming filled with tired desireshe however insists that it be a portraitlikenessi shall make her a present of furshow could i have any doubts if not for her for whom would princelyfurs be suitable    i was with her yesterday evening reading the _roman elegies_ to herthen i laid the book aside and improvised something for her sheseemed pleased rather more than that she actually hung upon mywords and her bosom heavedor was i mistakenthe rain beat in melancholy fashion on the windowpanes the firecrackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort i felt quite at homewith her and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful womani kissed her hand and she permitted itthen i sat down at her feet and read a short poem i had written forhervenus in fursplace thy foot upon thy slaveoh thou half of hell half of dreamsamong the shadows dark and gravethy extended body softly gleamsandso on this time i really got beyond the first stanza at herrequest i gave her the poem in the evening keeping no copy and nowas i am writing this down in my diary i can only remember the firststanzai am filled with a very curious sensation i don't believe that i amin love with wanda i am sure that at our first meeting i feltnothing of the lightninglike flashes of passion but i feel how herextraordinary really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snaresabout me it isn't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me itis a physical subjection coming on slowly but for that reason moreabsolutelyi suffer under it more and more each day and sheshe merely smiles    without any provocation she suddenly said to me today youinterest me most men are very commonplace without verve or poetryin you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and adeep seriousness which delight me i might learn to love youafter a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadowand the statue of venus all about us the earth steamed mists roseup toward heaven like clouds of incense a shattered rainbow stillhovered in the air the trees were still shedding drops but sparrowsand finches were already hopping from twig to twig they aretwittering gaily as if very much pleased at something everythingis filled with a fresh fragrance we cannot cross the meadow for itis still wet in the sunlight it looks like a small pool and thegoddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirrorlikesurface about her head a swarm of gnats is dancing whichilluminated by the sun seem to hover above her like an aureolewanda is enjoying the lovely scene as all the benches along thewalk are still wet she supports herself on my arm to rest a whilea soft weariness permeates her whole being her eyes are half closedi feel the touch of her breath on my cheekhow i managed to get up courage enough i really don't know but itook hold of her hand askingcould you love mewhy not she replied letting her calm clear look rest upon mebut not for longa moment later i am kneeling before her pressing my burning faceagainst the fragrant muslin of her gownbut severinthis isn't right she criedbut i take hold of her little foot and press my lips upon ityou are getting worse and worse she cried she tore herself freeand fled rapidly toward the house the while her adorable slipperremained in my handis it an omen    all day long i didn't dare to go near her toward evening as i wassitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through thegreenery of her balcony why don't you come up he called downimpatientlyi ran upstairs and at the top lost courage again i knocked verylightly she didn't say comein but opened the door herself andstood on the thresholdwhere is my slipperit isi havei want i stammeredget it and then we will have tea together and chatwhen i returned she was engaged in making tea i ceremoniouslyplaced the slipper on the table and stood in the corner like a childawaiting punishmenti noticed that her brows were slightly contracted and there was anexpression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delightedmeall of a sudden she broke out laughingsoyou are really in lovewith meyes and i suffer more from it than you can imagineyou suffer she laughed againi was revolted mortified annihilated but all this was quiteuselesswhy she continued i like you with all my heartshe gave me her hand and looked at me in the friendliest fashionand will you be my wifewanda looked at mehow did she look at me i think first of allwith surprise and then with a tinge of ironywhat has given you so much courage all at oncecourageyes courage to ask anyone to be your wife and me in particularshe lifted up the slipper was it through a sudden friendship withthis but joking aside do you really wish to marry meyeswell severin that is a serious matter i believe you love meand i care for you too and what is more important each of us findsthe other interesting there is no danger that we would soon getbored but you know i am a fickle person and just for that reasoni take marriage seriously if i assume obligations i want to be ableto meet them but i am afraidnoit would hurt youplease be perfectly frank with me i repliedwell then honestly i don't believe i could love a man longer thanshe inclined her head gracefully to one side and museda yearwhat do you imaginea month perhapsnot even meoh youperhaps twotwo months i exclaimedtwo months is very longyou go beyond antiquity madameyou see you cannot stand the truthwanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplacewatching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiecewhat shall i do with you she began anewwhatever you wish i replied with resignation whatever will giveyou pleasurehow illogical she cried first you want to make me your wifeand then you offer yourself to me as something to toy withwandai love younow we are back to the place where we started you love me andwant to make me your wife but i don't want to enter into a newmarriage because i doubt the permanence of both my and yourfeelingsbut if i am willing to take the risk with you i repliedbut it also depends on whether i am willing to risk it with youshe said quietly i can easily imagine belonging to one man for myentire life but he would have to be a whole man a man who woulddominate me who would subjugate me by his inate strength do youunderstand and every mani know this very wellas soon as he fallsin love becomes weak pliable ridiculous he puts himself into thewoman's hands kneels down before her the only man whom i could lovepermanently would be he before whom i should have to kneel i've gottento like you so much however that i'll try it with youi fell down at her feetfor heaven's sake here you are kneeling already she saidmockingly you are making a good beginning when i had risen againshe continued i will give you a year's time to win me to convinceme that we are suited to each other that we might live together ifyou succeed i will become your wife and a wife severin who willconscientiously and strictly perform all her duties during this yearwe will live as though we were marriedmy blood rose to my headin her eyes too there was a sudden flamewe will live together she continued share our daily life so thatwe may find out whether we are really fitted for each other _i grantyou all the rights of a husband of a lover of a friend_ are yousatisfiedi suppose i'll have to beyou don't have towell then i want tosplendid that is how a man speaks here is my hand    for ten days i have been with her every hour except at night allthe time i was allowed to look into her eyes hold her hands listento what she said accompany her wherever she wentmy love seems to me like a deep bottomless abyss into which isubside deeper and deeper there is nothing now which could save mefrom itthis afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of thevenusstatue i plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap shewound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddesssuddenly wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses becameconfused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration losingcommand over myself i threw my arms about her and clung to her lipsand sheshe drew me close to her heaving breastare you angry i then asked heri am never angry at anything that is natural she replied but_i_ am afraid you sufferoh i am suffering frightfullypoor friend she brushed my disordered hair back from my forehead ihope it isn't through any fault of mineno i repliedand yet my love for you has become a sort ofmadness the thought that i might lose you perhaps actually loseyou torments me day and nightbut you don't yet possess me said wanda and again she looked atme with that vibrant consuming expression which had already oncebefore carried me away then she rose and with her small transparenthands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white headof venus half against my will i threw my arm around her bodyi can no longer live without you oh wonderful woman i saidbelieve me believe only this once that this time it is not aphrase not a thing of dreams i feel deep down in my innermost soulthat my life belongs inseparably with yours if you leave me i shallperish go to piecesthat will hardly be necessary for i love you she took hold of mychin you foolish manbut you will be mine only under conditions while i belong to youunconditionallythat isn't wise severin she replied almost with a start don'tyou know me yet do you absolutely refuse to know me i am good wheni am treated seriously and reasonably but when you abandon yourselftoo absolutely to me i grow arrogantso be it be arrogant be despotic i cried in the fulness ofexaltation only be mine mine forever i lay at her feetembracing her kneesthings will end badly my friend she said soberly without movingit shall never end i cried excitedly almost violently only deathshall part us if you cannot be mine all mine and for always then _iwant to be your slave_ serve you suffer everything from you if onlyyou won't drive me awaycalm yourself she said bending down and kissing my forehead iam really very fond of you but your way is not the way to win andhold mei want to do everything absolutely everything that you want onlynot to lose you i cried only not that i cannot bear the thoughtdo get upi obeyedyou are a strange person continued wanda you wish to possess meat any priceyes at any pricebut of what value for instance would that beshe pondered alurking uncanny expression entered her eyesif i no longer lovedyou if i belonged to anothera shudder ran through me i looked at her she stood firmly andconfident before me and her eyes disclosed a cold gleamyou see she continued the very thought frightens you abeautiful smile suddenly illuminated her facei feel a perfect horror when i imagine that the woman i love andwho has responded to my love could give herself to another regardlessof me but have i still a choice if i love such a woman even untomadness shall i turn my back to her and lose everything for the sakeof a bit of boastful strength shall i send a bullet through mybrains i have two ideals of woman if i cannot obtain the one thatis noble and simple the woman who will faithfully and truly sharemy life well then i don't want anything halfway or lukewarm theni would rather be subject to a woman without virtue fidelity or pitysuch a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal ifi am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love fully and whollyi want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs i want tobe maltreated and betrayed by the woman i love and the more cruellythe better this too is a luxuryhave you lost your senses cried wandai love you with all my soul i continued with all my senses andyour presence and personality are absolutely essential to me if iam to go on living choose between my ideals do with me what you willmake of me your husband or your slavevery well said wanda contracting her small but strongly archedbrows it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a manwho interests me and loves me completely in my power at least ishall not lack pastime you were imprudent enough to leave the choiceto me therefore i choose i want you to be my slave i shall makea plaything for myself out of youoh please do i cried halfshuddering halfenraptured if thefoundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement it islikewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites weare such opposites almost enemies that is why my love is part hatepart fear in such a relation only one can be hammer and the otheranvil i wish to be the anvil i cannot be happy when i look downupon the woman i love i want to adore a woman and this i can onlydo when she is cruel towards mebut severin replied wanda almost angrily do you believe mecapable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do and whom i lovewhy not if i adore you the more on this account _it is possible tolove really only that which stands above us_ a woman who through herbeauty temperament intelligence and strength of will subjugates usand becomes a despot over usthen that which repels others attracts youyes that is the strange part of meperhaps after all there isn't anything so very unique or strangein all your passions for who doesn't love beautiful furs andeveryone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty arerelatedbut in my case all these elements are raised to their highestdegree i repliedin other words reason has little power over you and you are bynature soft sensual yieldingwere the martyrs also soft and sensual by naturethe martyrson the contrary they were _supersensual men_ who found enjoyment insuffering they sought out the most frightful tortures even deathitself as others seek joy and as they were so am i_supersensual_have a care that in being such you do not become a martyr to lovethe _martyr of a woman_we are sitting on wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrantsummer night a twofold roof is above us first the green ceiling ofclimbingplants and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerablestars the low wailing lovecall of a cat rises from the park i amsitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity and am telling herof my childhoodand even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly markedin you asked wandaof course i can't remember a time when i didn't have them even inmy cradle so mother has told me i was _supersensual_ i scorned thehealthy breast of my nurse and had to be brought up on goats' milkas a little boy i was mysteriously shy before women which really wasonly an expression of an inordinate interest in them i was oppressedby the gray arches and halfdarknesses of the church and actuallyafraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints secretlyhowever i sneaked as to a secret joy to a plastervenus which stoodin my father's little library i kneeled down before her and to her isaid the prayers i had been taughtthe paternoster the ave mariaand the credoonce at night i left my bed to visit her the sickle of the moonwas my light and showed me the goddess in a paleblue cold light iprostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet as i had seenour peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead savioran irresistible yearning seized mei got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the coldlips a deep shudder fell upon me and i fled and later in a dreamit seemed to me as if the goddess stood beside my bed threateningme with upraised armi was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium ipassionately grasped at everything which promised to make the worldof antiquity accessible to me soon i was more familiar with the godsof greece than with the religion of jesus i was with paris when hegave the fateful apple to venus i saw troy burn and followedulysses on his wanderings the prototypes of all that is beautifulsank deep into my soul and consequently at the time when other boysare coarse and obscene i displayed an insurmountable aversion toeverything base vulgar unbeautifulto me the maturing youth love for women seemed somethingespecially base and unbeautiful for it showed itself to me first inall its commonness i avoided all contact with the fair sex inshort i was supersensual to madnesswhen i was about fourteen my mother had a charming chambermaidyoung attractive with a figure just budding into womanhood i wassitting one day studying my tacitus and growing enthusiastic over thevirtues of the ancient teutons while she was sweeping my roomsuddenly she stopped bent down over me in the meantime holding fastto the broom and a pair of fresh full adorable lips touched minethe kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudderbut i raised up my _germania_ like a shield against the temptressand indignantly left the roomwanda broke out in loud laughter it would indeed be hard to findanother man like you but continuethere is another unforgetable incident belonging to that periodi continued my story countess sobol a distant aunt of mine wasvisiting my parents she was a beautiful majestic woman with anattractive smile i however hated her for she was regarded by thefamily as a sort of messalina my behavior toward her was as rudemalicious and awkward as possibleone day my parents drove to the capital of the district my auntdetermined to take advantage of their absence and to exercisejudgment over me she entered unexpectedly in her furlined_kazabaika_  followed by the cookkitchenmaid and the cat of a chambermaid whom i had scornedwithout asking any questions they seized me and bound me hand andfoot in spite of my violent resistance then my aunt with an evilsmile rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switchshe whipped so hard that the blood flowed and that at lastnotwithstanding my heroic spirit i cried and wept and begged formercy she then had me untied but i had to get down on my knees andthank her for the punishment and kiss her handnow you understand the supersensual fool under the lash of abeautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman in herfurjacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen and from then onmy aunt became the most desirable woman on god's earthmy catolike austerity my shyness before woman was nothing but anexcessive feeling for beauty in my imagination sensuality became asort of cult i took an oath to myself that i would not squander itsholy wealth upon any ordinary person but i would reserve it for anideal woman if possible for the goddess of love herselfi went to the university at a very early age it was in the capitalwhere my aunt lived my room looked at that time like doctorfaustus's everything in it was in a wild confusion there were hugeclosets stuffed full of books which i bought for a song from ajewish dealer on the servanica  there were globes atlases flasks charts of the heavensskeletons of animals skulls the busts of eminent men it looked asthough mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the hugegreen store as a wandering scholiast at any momenti studied everything in a jumble without system without selectionchemistry alchemy history astronomy philosophy law anatomy andliterature i read homer virgil ossian schiller goetheshakespeare cervantes voltaire moliere the koran the kosmoscasanova's memoirs i grew more confused each day more fantasticalmore supersensual all the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in myimagination every so and so often she appeared before me like avision among my leatherbound books and dead bones lying on a bed ofroses surrounded by cupids sometimes she appeared gowned like theolympians with the stern white face of the plaster venus sometimes inbraids of a rich brown blueeyes in my aunt's red velvet_kazabaika_ trimmed with ermineone morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of myimagination in all her smiling beauty i went to see countess sobolwho received me in a friendly even cordial manner she gave me akiss of welcome which put all my senses in a turmoil she wasprobably about forty years old but like most wellpreserved womenof the world still very attractive she wore as always her furedgedjacket this time it was one of green velvet with brown marten butnothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time wasnow discernableon the contrary there was so little of cruelty in her that withoutany more ado she let me adore heronly too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocenceand it pleased her to make me happy as for myselfi was as happyas a young god what rapture for me to be allowed to lie before heron my knees and to kiss her hands those with which she had scourgedme what marvellous hands they were of beautiful form delicaterounded and white with adorable dimples i really was in love withher hands only i played with them let them submerge and emerge inthe dark fur held them against the light and was unable to satiatemy eyes with themwanda involuntarily looked at her hand i noticed it and had tosmilefrom the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in thosedays you can see that i was in love only with the cruel lashes ireceived from my aunt and about two years later when i paid courtto a young actress only in the roles she played still later i becamethe admirer of a respectable woman she acted the part ofirreproachable virtue only in the end to betray me with a rich jewyou see it is because i was betrayed sold by a woman who feignedthe strictest principles and the highest ideals that i hate thatsort of poetical sentimental virtue so intensely give me rather awoman who is honest enough to say to me i am a pompadour a lucretiaborgia and i am ready to adore herwanda rose and opened the windowyou have a curious way of arousing one's imagination stimulatingall one's nerves and making one's pulses beat faster you put anaureole on vice provided only if it is honest your ideal is adaring courtesan of genius oh you are the kind of man who willcorrupt a woman to her very last fiber    in the middle of the night there was a knock at my window i got upopened it and was startled without stood venus in furs just asshe had appeared to me the first timeyou have disturbed me with your stories i have been tossing aboutin bed and can't go to sleep she said now come and stay with mein a momentas i entered wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she hadkindled a small fireautumn is coming she began the nights are really quite coldalready i am afraid you may not like it but i can't put off my fursuntil the room is sufficiently warmnot like ityou are jokingyou know i threw my arm around herand kissed herof course i know but why this great fondness for fursi was born with it i replied i already had it as a childfurthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organizednatures this is due both to general and natural laws it is aphysical stimulus which sets you tingling and no one can whollyescape it science has recently shown a certain relationship betweenelectricity and warmth at any rate their effects upon the humanorganism are related the torrid zone produces more passionatecharacters a heated atmosphere stimulation likewise withelectricity this is the reason why the presence of cats exercisessuch a magic influence upon highlyorganized men of intellect thisis why these longtailed graces of the animal kingdom theseadorable scintillating electric batteries have been the favoriteanimal of a mahommed cardinal richelieu crebillon rousseauwielanda woman wearing furs then cried wanda is nothing else than alarge cat an augmented electric batterycertainly i replied that is my explanation of the symbolicmeaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beautymonarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it inthis sense for their costume exclusively great painters used itonly for queenly beauty the most beautiful frame which raphaelcould find for the divine forms of fornarina and titian for theroseate body of his beloved was dark fursthanks for the learned discourse on love said wanda but youhaven't told me everything you associate something entirelyindividual with furscertainly i cried i have repeatedly told you that suffering hasa peculiar attraction for me nothing can intensify my passion morethan tyranny cruelty and especially the faithlessness of abeautiful woman and i cannot imagine this woman this strange idealderived from an aesthetics of ugliness this soul of nero in the bodyof a phryne except in fursi understand wanda interrupted it gives a dominant and imposingquality to a womannot only that i continued you know i am _supersensual_ with meeverything has its roots in the imagination and thence it receivesits nourishment i was already prematurely developed and highlysensitive when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrsfell into my hands i remember reading with a kind of horror whichreally was rapture of how they pined in prisons were laid on thegridiron pierced with arrows boiled in pitch thrown to wildanimals nailed to the cross and suffered the most horrible tormentwith a kind of joy to suffer and endure cruel torture from then onseemed to me exquisite delight especially when it was inflicted by abeautiful woman for ever since i can remember all poetry andeverything demonic was for me concentrated in woman i literallycarried the idea into a sort of culti felt there was something sacred in sex in fact it was the onlysacred thing in woman and her beauty i saw something divine becausethe most important function of existencethe continuation of thespeciesis her vocation to me woman represented a personification ofnature _isis_ and man was her priest her slave in contrast to himshe was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has servedher purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it to him hercruelties even death itself still were sensual rapturesi envied king gunther whom the mighty brunhilde fettered on thebridal night and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistresshad sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game ienvied the knight ctirad whom the daring amazon scharka craftilyensnared in a forest near prague and carried to her castle divinwhere after having amused herself a while with him she had himbroken on the wheeldisgusting cried wanda i almost wish you might fall into thehands of a woman of their savage race in the wolf's skin under theteeth of the dogs or upon the wheel you would lose the taste foryour kind of poetrydo you think so i hardly dohave you actually lost your sensespossibly but let me go on i developed a perfect passion forreading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described iloved especially to look at pictures and prints which representedthem all the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne theinquisitors who had the heretics tortured roasted and butcheredall the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustfulbeautiful and violent women like libussa lucretia borgia agnes ofhungary queen margot isabeau the sultana roxolane the russianczarinas of last centuryall these i saw in furs or in robesbordered with ermineand so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you said wanda andsimultaneously she began to drape her magnificent furcloakcoquettishly about her so that the dark shining sable playedbeautifully around her bust and arms well how do you feel nowhalf broken on the wheelher piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mockingsatisfaction overcome by desire i flung myself down before her andthrew my arms about heryesyou have awakened my dearest dream i cried it has sleptlong enoughand this is she put her hand on my necki was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of thiswarm little hand and of her regard which tenderly searching fellupon me through her halfclosed lids_to be the slave of a woman a beautiful woman whom i love whomi worship_and who on that account maltreats you interrupted wanda laughingyes who fetters me and whips me treads me underfoot the whileshe gives herself to anotherand who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present ofyou to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you mustmeet him face to face who will turn you over to his absolute mercywhy not this final tableau doesn't please you so welli looked at wanda frightenedyou surpass my dreamsyes we women are inventive she said take heed when you findyour ideal it might easily happen that she will treat you morecruelly than you anticipatei am afraid that i have already found my ideal i exclaimedburying my burning face in her lapnot i exclaimed wanda throwing off her furs and moving about theroom laughing she was still laughing as i went downstairs and wheni stood musing in the yard i still heard her peals of laughter above    do you really then expect me to embody your ideal wanda askedarchly when we met in the park todayat first i could find no answer the most antagonistic emotions werebattling within me in the meantime she sat down on one of thestonebenches and played with a flowerwellam ii kneeled down and seized her handsonce more i beg you to become my wife my true and loyal wife ifyou can't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal absolutelywithout reservation without softnessyou know i am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand ifyou prove to be the man i am seeking wanda replied very seriouslybut i think you would be more grateful to me if through me yourealized your imaginings well which do you preferi believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent inyour personalityyou are mistakeni believe i continued that you enjoy having a man wholly inyour power torturing himno no she exclaimed quickly or perhaps she ponderedi don't understand myself any longer she continued but i havea confession to make to you you have corrupted my imagination andinflamed my blood i am beginning to like the things you speak ofthe enthusiasm with which you speak of a pompadour a catherine thesecond and all the other selfish frivolous cruel women carriesme away and takes hold of my soul it urges me on to become like thosewomen who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored duringtheir lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their gravesyou will end by making of me a despot in miniature a domesticpompadourwell then i said in agitation if all this is inherent in yougive way to this trend of your nature nothing halfway if you can'tbe a true and loyal wife to me be a demoni was nervous from loss of sleep and the proximity of the beautifulwoman affected me like a fever i no longer recall what i said buti remember that i kissed her feet and finally raised her foot andput my neck under it she withdrew it quickly and rose almost angrilyif you love me severin she said quickly and her voice soundedsharp and commanding never speak to me of those things againunderstand never otherwise i might really she smiled and satdown againi am entirely serious i exclaimed halfraving i adore you soinfinitely that i am willing to suffer anything from you for thesake of spending my whole life near youseverin once more i warn youyour warning is vain do with me what you will as long as youdon't drive me awayseverin replied wanda i am a frivolous young woman it isdangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power you willend by actually becoming a plaything

looked into my eyes and shookher headi am afraid i can't but i will try for your sake for i love youseverin as i have loved no other man    today she suddenly took her hat and shawl and i had to go shoppingwith her she looked at whips long whips with a short handle thekind that are used on dogsare these satisfactory said the shopkeeperno they are much too small replied wanda with a sideglance atme i need a largefor a bulldog i suppose opined the merchantyes she exclaimed of the kind that are used in russia forintractable slavesshe looked further and finally selected a whip at whose sight ifelt a strange creeping sensationnow goodby severin she said i have some other purchases tomake but you can't go alongi left her and took a walk on the way back i saw wanda coming outat a furrier's she beckoned meconsider it well she began in good spirits i have never made asecret of how deeply your serious dreamy character has fascinatedme the idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power actuallylying enraptured at my feet of course stimulates mebut will thisattraction last woman loves a man she maltreats a slave and endsby kicking him asidevery well then kick me aside i replied when you are tired ofme i want to be your slavedangerous forces lie within me said wanda after we had gone afew steps further you awaken them and not to your advantage youknow how to paint pleasure cruelty arrogance in glowing colorswhat would you say should i try my hand at them and make you thefirst object of my experiments i would be like dionysius who had theinventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether hiswails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an oxperhaps i am a female dionysiusbe it i exclaimed and my dreams will be fulfilled i am yoursfor good or evil choose the destiny that lies concealed within mybreast drives me ondemoniacallyrelentlesslymy belovedi do not care to see you today or tomorrow and not until eveningthe day after tomorrow and then _as my

way she commanded on your kneesi obeyed and she began to apply the lashthe blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms each onecut into my flesh and burned there but the pains enraptured me theycame from her whom i adored and for whom i was ready at any hour tolay down my lifeshe stopped i am beginning to enjoy it she said but enough fortoday i am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to

youlose your senses you have awakened dangerous elements in my beingbut now get upi seized her hand to press it to my lipswhat impudenceshe shoved me away with her footout of my sight slave    after having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams iawoke dawn was just beginning to breakhow much of what was hovering in my memory was true what had iactually experienced and what had i dreamed that i had been whippedwas certain i can still feel each blow and count the burning redstripes on my body and _she_ whipped me now i know everythingmy dream has become truth how does it make

amashamed of myself she says while i embrace her and she hides herhead against my breastwhyplease try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday she said withquivering voice i have fulfilled your mad wish now let us bereasonable and happy and love each other and in a year i will beyour wifemy mistress i exclaimed and i your slavenot another word of slavery cruelty or the whip interruptedwanda i shall not grant you any of those favors none exceptwearing my furjacket come and help me into it    the little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot hisbolt struck midnighti rose and wanted to leavewanda said nothing but embraced me and drew me back on the ottomanshe began to kiss me anew and this silent language was socomprehensible so convincingand it told me more than i dared to understanda languid abandonment pervaded wanda's entire being what avoluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her halfclosedeyes in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under thewhite powder in the red and white satin which crackled about herwith every movement in the swelling ermine of the _kazabaika_in which she carelessly nestledplease i stammered but you will be angry with medo with me what you will she whisperedwell then whip me or i shall go madhaven't i forbidden you said wanda sternly but you areincorrigibleoh i am so terribly in love i had sunken on my knees and wasburying my glowing face in her lapi really believe said wanda thoughtfully that your madness isnothing but a demonic unsatisfied sensuality _our unnatural wayof life must generate such illnesses_ were you less virtuous youwould be completely sanewell then make me sane i murmured my hands were running throughher hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur which roseand fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom and drove allmy senses into confusionand i kissed her no she kissed me savagely pitilessly as if shewanted to slay me with her kisses i was as in a delirium and hadlong since lost my reason but now i too was breathless i soughtto free myselfwhat is the matter asked wandai am suffering agoniesyou are suffering she broke out into a loud amused laughteryou laugh i moaned have you no ideashe was serious all of a sudden she raised my head in her handsand with a violent gesture drew me to her breastwanda i stammeredof course you enjoy suffering she said and laughed again butwait i'll bring you to your sensesno i will no longer ask i exclaimed whether you want to belongto me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication i wantto drain my happiness to the full you are mine now and i wouldrather lose you than never to have had younow you are sensible she said she kissed me again with hermurderous lips i tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace andher naked breast surged against minethen my senses left methe first thing i remember is the moment when i saw blood drippingfrom my hand and she asked apathetically did you scratch meno i believe i have bitten you    it is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face assoon as a new person enterswe spent marvellous days together we visited the mountains andlakes we read together and i completed wanda's portrait and howwe loved one another how beautiful her smiling face wasthen a friend of hers arrived a divorced woman somewhat older moreexperienced and less scrupulous than wanda her influence is alreadymaking itself felt in every directionwanda wrinkles her brows and displays a certain impatience with mehas she ceased loving me    for almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon usher friend lives with her and we are never alone a circle of mensurrounds the young women with my seriousness and melancholy i amplaying an absurd role as lover wanda treats me like a strangertoday while out walking she staid behind with me i saw that thiswas done intentionally and i rejoiced but what did she tell memy friend doesn't understand how i can love you she doesn't thinkyou either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise she istelling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolouslife in the capital hinting at the advantages to which i could layclaim the large parties which i would find there and thedistinguished and handsome admirers which i would attract but ofwhat use is all this since it happens that i love youfor a moment i lost my breath then i said i have no wish to standin the way of your happiness wanda do not consider me then iraised my hat and let her go ahead she looked at me surprised butdid not answer a syllablewhen by chance i happened to be close to her on the way back shesecretly pressed my hand her glance was so radiant so full ofpromised happiness that in a moment all the torments of these dayswere forgotten and all their wounds healedi now am aware again of how much i love her    my friend has complained about you said wanda todayperhaps she feels that i despise herbut why do you despise her you foolish young man exclaimedwanda pulling my ears with both handsbecause she is a hypocrite i said i respect only a woman who isactually virtuous or who openly lives for pleasure's sakelike me for instance replied wanda jestingly but you seechild a woman can only do that in the rarest cases she can neitherbe as gaily sensual nor as spiritually free as man her state isalways a mixture of the sensual and spiritual her heart desires toenchain man permanently while she herself is ever subject to thedesire for change the result is a conflict and thus usually againsther wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personalityand corrupt her charactercertainly that is true i said the transcendental character withwhich woman wants to stamp love leads her to deceptionbut the world likewise demands it wanda interrupted look atthis woman she has a husband and a lover in lemberg and has founda new admirer here she deceives all three and yet is honored by alland respected by the worldi don't care i exclaimed but she is to leave you alone shetreats you like an article of commercewhy not the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously every womanhas the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractionsand much is to be said for giving one's self without love or pleasurebecause if you do it in cold blood you can reap profit to bestadvantagewanda what are you sayingwhy not she said and take note of what i am about to say to you_never feel secure with the woman you love_ for there are moredangers in woman's nature than you imagine women are neither as_good_ as their admirers and defenders maintain nor as _bad_ as theirenemies make them out to be _woman's character is characterlessness_the best woman will momentarily go down into the mire and the worstunexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts toshame those that despise her no woman is so good or so bad but thatat any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of themost divine of the filthiest as well as of the purest thoughtsemotions and actions in spite of all the advances of civilizationwoman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature she has thenature of a savage who is faithful or faithless magnanimous orcruel according to the impulse that dominates at the momentthroughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which hasproduced moral character man even when he is selfish or evil alwaysfollows _principles_ woman never follows anything but _impulses_don't ever forget that and never feel secure with the woman youlove    her friend has left at last an evening alone with her again itseems as if wanda had saved up all the love which had been kept fromher for this superlative evening never had she been so kind sonear so full of tendernesswhat happiness to cling to her lips and to die away in her arms ina state of relaxation and wholly mine her head rests against mybreast and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each otheri cannot yet believe comprehend that this woman is mine whollymineshe is right on one point wanda began without moving withoutopening her eyes as if she were asleepwhoshe remained silentyour friendshe nodded yes she is right you are not a man you are adreamer a charming cavalier and you certainly would be a pricelessslave but i cannot imagine you as husbandi was frightenedwhat is the matter you are tremblingi tremble at the thought of how easily i might lose you i repliedare you made less happy now because of this she replied doesit rob you of any of your joys that i have belonged to anotherbefore i did to you that others after you will possess me and wouldyou enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with youwandayou see she continued that would be a way out you won't everlose me then i care deeply for you and intellectually we areharmonious and i should like to live with you always if in additionto you i might havewhat an idea i cried you fill me with a sort of horrordo you love me any the lesson the contrarywanda had raised herself on her left arm i believe she saidthat to hold a man permanently it is vitally important not to befaithful to him what honest woman has ever been as devotedly lovedas a hetairathere is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a belovedwoman it is the highest kind of ecstacyfor you too wanda asked quicklyfor me tooand if i should give you that pleasure wanda exclaimed mockinglyi shall suffer terrible agonies but i shall adore you the morei replied but you would never deceive me you would have the daemonicgreatness of saying to me i shall love no one but you but i shallmake happy whoever pleases mewanda shook her head i don't like deception i am honest but whatman exists who can support the burden of truth were i say to youthis serene sensual life this paganism is my ideal would you bestrong enough to bear itcertainly i could endure anything so as not to lose you i feelhow little i really mean to youbut severinbut it is so said i and just for that reasonfor that reason you would she smiled roguishlyhave i guesseditbe your slave i exclaimed be your unrestricted propertywithout a will of my own of which you could dispose as you wishedand which would therefore never be a burden to you while you drinklife at its fullness while surrounded by luxury you enjoy theserene happiness and olympian love i want to be your servant puton and take off your shoesyou really aren't so far from wrong replied wanda for only asmy slave could you endure my loving others furthermore the freedomof enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery itmust give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel beforeone and tremble i want a slave do you hear severinam i not your slavethen listen to me said wanda excitedly seizing my hand i wantto be yours as long as i love youa monthperhaps even twoand thenthen you become my slaveand youi why do you ask i am a goddess and sometimes i descend from myolympian heights to you softly very softly and secretlybut what does all this mean said wanda resting her head in bothhands with her gaze lost in the distance a golden fancy which nevercan become true an uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over herentire being i have never seen her like thatwhy unachievable i beganbecause slavery doesn't exist any longerthen we will go to a country where it still exists to the orientto turkey i said eagerlyyou wouldseverinin all seriousness wanda replied her eyesburnedyes in all seriousness i want to be your slave i continued iwant your power over me to be sanctified by law i want my life tobe in your hands i want nothing that could protect or save me fromyou oh what a voluptuous joy when once i feel myself entirely dependentupon your absolute will your whim at your beck and call and thenwhat happiness when at some time you deign to be gracious and theslave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him i kneltdown and leaned my burning forehead against her kneeyou are talking as in a fever said wanda agitatedly and youreally love me so endlessly she held me to her breast and coveredme with kissesyou really want iti swear to you now by god and my honor that i shall be your slavewherever and whenever you wish it as soon as you command iexclaimed hardly master of myselfand if i take you at your word said wandaplease doall this appeals to me she said then it is different fromanything elseto know that a man who worships me and whom i lovewith all my heart is so wholly mine dependent on my will andcaprice my possession and slave while ishe looked strangely at meif i should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame shecontinued it almost seems as if you were afraid of me already butyou have swornand i shall keep my oathi shall see to that she replied i am beginning to enjoy itand heaven help me we won't stick to fancies now you shall becomemy slave and ii shall try to be _venus in furs_    i thought that at last i knew this woman understood her and now isee i have to begin at the very beginning again only a little whileago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile and now shetries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousnessshe has drawn up a contract according to which i give my word ofhonor and agree under oath to be her slave as long as she wisheswith her arm around my neck she reads this unprecedentedincredible document to me the end of each sentence she punctuateswith a kissbut all the obligations in the contract are on my side i saidteasing herof course she replied with great seriousness you cease to be mylover and consequently i am released from all duties and obligationstowards you you will have to look upon my favors as purebenevolence you no longer have any rights and no longer can layclaim to any there can be no limit to my power over you rememberthat you won't be much better than a dog or some inanimate objectyou will be mine my plaything which i can break to pieces wheneveri want an hour's amusement you are nothing i am everything do youunderstand she laughed and kissed me again and yet a sort of coldshiver ran through mewon't you allow me a few conditions i beganconditions she contracted her forehead ah you are afraidalready or perhaps you regret but it is too late now you havesworn i have your word of honor but let me hear themfirst of all i should like to have it included in our contractthat you will never completely leave me and then that you will nevergive me over to the mercies of any of your admirersbut severin exclaimed wanda with her voice full of emotion andwith tears in her eyes how can you imagine that iand you a manwho loves me so absolutely who puts himself so entirely in my powershe haltedno no i said covering her hands with kisses i don't fearanything from you that might dishonor me forgive me the uglythoughtwanda smiled happily leaned her cheek against mine and seemed toreflectyou have forgotten something she whispered coquettishly themost important thinga conditionyes that i must always wear my furs exclaimed wanda but ipromise you i'll do that anyhow because they give me a despoticfeeling and i shall be very cruel to you do you understandshall i sign the contract i askednot yet said wanda i shall first add your conditions and theactual signing won't occur until the proper time and placein constantinopleno i have thought things over what special value would there bein owning a slave where everyone owns slaves what i want is to_have a slave i alone_ here in our civilized sober philistineworld and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely onaccount of my beauty and personality not because of law of propertyrights or compulsions this attracts me but at any rate we will goto a country where we are not known and where you can appear beforethe world as my servant without embarrassment perhaps to italy torome or naples    we were sitting on wanda's ottoman she wore her ermine jacket herhair was loose and fell like a lion's mane down her back she clungto my lips drawing my soul from my body my head whirled my bloodbegan to seethe my heart beat violently against hersi want to be absolutely in your power wanda i exclaimedsuddenly seized by that frenzy of passion when i can scarcely thinkclearly or decide freely i want to put myself absolutely at yourmercy for good or evil without any condition without any limit toyour powerwhile saying this i had slipped from the ottoman and lay at herfeet looking up at her with drunken eyeshow beautiful you now are she exclaimed your eyes halfbrokenin ecstacy fill me with joy carry me away how wonderful your lookwould be if you were being beaten to death in the extreme agony youhave the eye of a martyr    sometimes nevertheless i have an uneasy feeling about placingmyself so absolutely so unconditionally into a woman's handssuppose she did abuse my passion her powerwell then i would experience what has occupied my imagination sincemy childhood what has always given me the feeling of seductiveterror a foolish apprehension it will be a wanton game she will playwith me nothing more she loves me and she is good a noblepersonality incapable of a breach of faith but it lies in her hands_if she wants to she can_ what a temptation in this doubt thisfearnow i understand manon l'escault and the poor chevalier who evenin the pillory while she was another man's mistress still adoredherlove knows no virtue no profit it loves and forgives and sufferseverything because it must it is not our judgment that leads usit is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover thatmake us abandon ourselves or that repel usit is a sweet soft enigmatic power that drives us on we cease tothink to feel to will we let ourselves be carried away by it andask not whither    a russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenadehe aroused general interest on account of his athletic figuremagnificent face and splendid bearing the women particularly gapedat him as though he were a wild animal but he went his way gloomilywithout paying attention to any one he was accompanied by twoservants one a negro completely dressed in red satin and the othera circassian in his full gleaming uniform suddenly he saw wanda andfixed his cold piercing look upon her he even turned his head afterher and when she had passed he stood still and followed her withhis eyesand sheshe veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyesanddid everything possible to meet him againthe cunning coquetry with which she walked moved and looked athim almost stifled me on the way home i remarked about it she knither browswhat do you want she said the prince is a man whom i

until youcan answer my questionsit was not till afternoon that i could obtain the desiredinformation for wanda she let me stand before her like a servantwhile she leaned back in her armchair and listened to me smilingthen she nodded she seemed to be satisfiedbring me my footstool she commanded shortlyi obeyed and after having put it before her and having put her feeton it i remained kneelinghow will this end i asked sadly after a short pauseshe broke into playful laughter why things haven't even begun yetyou are more heartless than i imagined i replied hurtseverin wanda began earnestly i haven't done anything yet notthe slightest thing and you are already calling me heartless whatwill happen when i begin to carry your dreams to their realizationwhen i shall lead a gay free

apowerful impulse fills my whole being now that i enjoy it now thati cannot and do not want to do otherwise now you want to back outyouare you a mandear sweet wanda i began to caress her kiss

despotic woman of my dreams herexpression seemed hard and nothing lay in her eyes that promisedkindness or mercywell she said at lastyou are angry i cried you will punish meoh no she replied i shall let you go you are free i am notholding youwandai who love you soyes you my dear sir you who adore me she exclaimedcontemptuously but who are a coward a liar and a breaker ofpromises leave me

while i remained crushedon my knees my head was hanging supine tears flowed from my eyescome here wanda commanded harshly sitting down on the ottomani obeyed her command and sat down beside her she looked at mesombrely and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interiorof her eye smiling she drew me toward her breast and began to kissthe tears out of my eyes    the odd part of my situation is that i am like the bear in lily'spark i can escape and don't want to i am ready to endure everythingas soon as she threatens to set me free    if only she would use the whip again there is something uncanny inthe kindness with which she treats me i seem like a little captivemouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays she is ready at anymoment to tear it to pieces and my heart of a mouse threatens toburstwhat are her intentions what does she purpose to do with me    it seems she has completely forgotten the contract my slavehood orwas it actually only stubbornness and she gave up her whole plan assoon as i no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whimhow kind she is to me how tender how loving we are spendingmarvellously happy daystoday she had me read to her the scene between faust andmephistopheles in which the latter appears as a wandering scholarher glance hung on me with strange pleasurei don't understand she said when i had finished how a man whocan read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression andinterpret them so clearly concisely and intelligently can at thesame time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you arewere you pleased said i and kissed her foreheadshe gently stroked my brow i love you severin she whispered idon't believe i could ever love any one more than you let us besensible what do you sayinstead of replying i folded her in my arms a deep inward yetvaguely sad happiness filled my breast my eyes grew moist and atear fell upon her handhow can you cry she exclaimed you are a child    on a pleasure drive we met the russian prince in his carriage heseemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by wanda's side andlooked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with hiselectric gray eyes she however did not seem to notice him i feltat that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feetshe let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were aninanimate object a tree for instance and turned to me with hergracious smile    when i said goodnight to her today she seemed suddenlyunaccountably distracted and moody what was occupying heri am sorry you are going she said when i was already standing onthe thresholdit is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of mytrial to cease tormenting me i pleadeddo you imagine that this compulsion isn't a torment for me toowanda interjectedthen end it i exclaimed embracing her be my wife_never severin_ she said gently but with great firmnesswhat do you meani was frightened in my innermost soul_you are not the man for me_i looked at her and slowly withdrew my arm which was still abouther waist then i left the room and sheshe did not call me back    a sleepless night i made countless decisions only to toss themaside again in the morning i wrote her a letter in which i declaredour relationship dissolved my hand trembled when i put on the sealand i burned my fingersas i went upstairs to hand it to the maid my knees threatened togive waythe door opened and wanda thrust forth her head full of curlingpapersi haven't had my hair dressed yet she said smiling what haveyou therea letterfor mei noddedah

pleasure and stimulationbut madame you know my circumstances i began in my confusioni am dependent on my father and i doubt whether he will give me thelarge sum of money needed for this journeythat means you have no money gregor said wanda delightedly somuch the better you are then entirely dependent on me and in factmy slaveyou don't consider i tried to object that as man of honor it

and to obeywhatever i command now leave me gregori turned toward the doornot yetyou may first kiss my hand she held it out to me with acertain proud indifference and i the dilettante the donkey

evening my light was still lit and a firewas burning in the large green stove there were still many thingsamong my letters and documents to be put in order autumn as isusually the case with us had

the whipyou are very beautiful mistresswanda smiled and sat down in the armchair kneel downhere besidemy chairi obeyedkiss my handi seized her small cold hand and kissed itand the mouthin a surge of passion i threw my arms around the beautiful cruelwoman and covered her face arms and breast with glowing kissesshe returned them with equal fervorthe eyelids closed as in adream it was after midnight

interesting drama of my life hadreached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossibleto foretellso far everything went well i sat beside wanda and she chattedvery graciously and intelligently with me as with a good friendconcerning italy pisemski's new novel and wagner's music she worea sort of amazonesque travellingdress of black cloth with a shortjacket of the same material set with dark fur it fitted closely andshowed her figure to best advantage over it she wore dark furs herhair wound into an antique knot lay beneath a small dark furhatfrom which a black veil hung wanda was in very good humor she fedme candies played with my hair loosened my neck cloth and made apretty cockade of it she covered my knees with her furs andstealthily pressed the fingers of my hand when our jewish driverpersistently went on nodding to himself she even gave me a kiss andher cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnalrose which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves andupon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice    we are at the district capital we get out at the railway stationwanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm and goesto secure the ticketswhen she returns she has completely changedhere is your ticket gregor she says in a tone which superciliousladies use to their servantsa thirdclass ticket i reply with

don'tforget and now give me my fursafter i had helped her into them humbly like a slave she went tofind an empty firstclass coupe i followed supporting herself onmy shoulder she got on and i wrapped her feet in bearskins and placedthem on the warming bottlethen she nodded to me and dismissed me i slowly ascended a thirdclasscarriage which was filled with abominable tobaccosmoke that seemedlike the fogs of acheron at the entrance to hades i now had the leisureto muse about the riddle of human existence and about its greatestriddle of all_woman_    whenever the train stops i jump off run to her carriage and withdrawn cap await her orders she wants coffee and then a glass ofwater at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands andthus it goes on she lets several men who have entered hercompartment pay court to her i am dying of jealousy and have to leapabout like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly andnot miss the trainin this way the night passes i haven't had time to eat a mouthfuland i can't sleep i have to breathe the same oniony air with polishpeasants jewish peddlers and common soldierswhen i mount the steps of her coupe she is lying stretched outon cushions in her comfortable furs covered up with the skins ofanimals she is like an oriental despot and the men sit like indiandeities straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare tobreathe    she stops over in vienna for a day to go shopping and particularlyto buy series of luxurious gowns she continues to treat me as herservant i follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces shehands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind lookand laden down like a donkey i pant along behindbefore leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotelwaiters i am ordered to put on her livery it is a cracovian costumein her colors lightblue with red facings and red quadrangular capornamented with peacockfeathers the costume is rather becoming tomethe silver

the nightthrough the sea of dreamssailing without ceasesailing goes my soulin thine to find releaseand i am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regalcomfort among her soft furs

scream i hadbeen dreaming of an icefield in which i had lost my way i had beenlooking in vain for a way out suddenly an eskimo drove up in asleigh harnessed with reindeer he had the face of the waiter who hadshown me to the unheated roomwhat are you looking for here my dear sir he exclaimed this isthe north polea moment later he had disappeared and wanda flew over the smoothice on tiny skates her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled theermine of her jacket and cap but especially her face gleamed whiterthan the snow she shot toward me inclosed me in her arms and beganto kiss me suddenly i felt my blood running warm down my sidewhat are you doing i asked horrorstrickenshe laughed and as i looked at her now it was no longer wanda buta huge white shebear who was digging her paws into my

there was scarcelya street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bearthe sign _camere ammobiliate_ wanda always sent me upstairs and onlywhen the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herselfascend by noon i was as tired as a staghound after the huntwe entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitablehabitation wanda was already somewhat out

deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs andin seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle inthe precious soft furs and to lift the flowing hair over the collarwhen she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of herbody still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable it is enough todrive one mad    finally a day came when there were neither guests nor theater norother company i breathed a sigh of relief wanda sat in the galleryreading and apparently had no orders for me at dusk when thesilvery evening mists fell she withdrew i served her at dinner

sleepingfurs her arms beneath her neck with aflood of red hair over them i heard her magnificent breast rise indeep regular breathing and whenever she moved ever so slightly iwoke up and listened to see whether she needed mebut she did not require meno task was required of me i meant no more to her than a nightlamp ora revolver which one places under one's pillow    am i mad or is she does all this arise out of an inventive wantonwoman's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensualfantasies or is this woman really one of those neronian characterswho take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot like a wormhuman beings who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirswhat have i experiencedwhen i knelt with the coffeetray beside her bed wanda suddenlyplaced her hand on

coachman who withdrew insurprisei ascended the driver's seat and angrily whipped up the horsesin the cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path wandagot out it was night only occasional stars shone through the grayclouds that fled across the sky by the bank of the arno stood a manin a dark cloak with a brigand's hat and looked at the yellowwaves wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery and tapped him onthe shoulder i saw him turn and seize her hand and then theydisappeared behind the green wallan hour full of torments finally there was a rustling in the bushesto one side

the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green levelof the meadow the camelias at the foot of the gallery are gloriousin their abundant buds wanda is sitting in the loggia she isdrawing the german painter stands opposite her with his hands foldedas in adoration and looks at her no he rather looks at her faceand is entirely absorbed in it enrapturedbut she does not see him neither does she see me who with thespade in my hand am turning over the flowerbed solely that i maysee her and feel her nearness which produces an effect on me likepoetry like music    the painter has gone

sympathy for you still trembles in mybreast when that too has gone who knows whether then i shall giveyou your liberty whether i shall not then become really cruelmerciless even brutal toward whether

i visited the venus of mediciit was still early and the little octagonal room in the tribuna wasfilled with halflights like a sanctuary i stood with folded handsin deep adoration before the silent image of the divinitybut i did not stand for longnot a human soul was in the gallery not even an englishman and ifell down on my knees i looked up at the lovely slender body thebudding breasts the virginal and yet voluptuous face the fragrantcurls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead    my mistress's bellit is noonday she however is still abed with her arms intertwinedbehind her necki want to bathe she says and you will attend me lock the doori obeynow go downstairs and make sure the door below is also lockedi descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to thebath my feet gave way beneath me and i had to support myselfagainst the iron banister after having ascertained that the doorleading to the loggia and the garden was locked i returned wandawas now sitting on the bed with loosened hair wrapped in her greenvelvet furs when she made a rapid movement i noticed that the furswere her only covering it made me start terribly i don't know whyi was like one condemned to death who knows he is on the way to thescaffold and yet begins to tremble when he sees itcome gregor take me on your armsyou mean mistressyou are to carry me don't you understandi lifted her up so that she rested in my arms while she twinedhers around my neck slowly step by step i went down the stairswith her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and herfoot sought support against my knee i trembled under the beautifulburden i was carrying and every moment it seemed as if i had tobreak down beneath itthe bath consisted of a wide high rotunda which received a softquiet light from a red glass cupola above two palms extended theirbroad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions from heresteps covered with turkish rugs led to the white marble basin whichoccupied the centerthere is a green ribbon on my toilettable upstairs said wandaas i let her down on the couch go get it and also bring the whipi flew upstairs and back again and kneeling put both in my mistress'shands she then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knotwhich i fastened with the green ribbon then i prepared the bath i didthis very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me againand again i had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvetcushions and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here andthere beneath the furs some magnetic power stronger than my willcompelled me to look i felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies inthat which is halfconcealed or intentionally disclosed and the truthof this i recognized even more acutely when the basin at last was fulland wanda threw off the furcloak with a single gesture and stoodbefore me like the goddess in the tribunaat that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiledbeauty as did the divinity of long ago i sank down on my kneesbefore her and devoutly pressed my lips on her footmy soul which had been stormtossed only a little while earliersuddenly was perfectly calm and i now felt no element of cruelty inwandashe slowly descended the stairs and i could watch her with acalmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire wasintermingled i could see her plunge into and rise out of thecrystalline water and the wavelets which she herself raised playedabout her like tender loversour nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says a real apple ismore beautiful than a painted one and a living woman is morebeautiful than a venus of stoneand when she left the bath and the silvery drops and the roseatelight rippled down her body i was seized with silent rapture iwrapped the linen sheets about her drying her glorious body thecalm bliss remained with me even now when one foot upon me as upona footstool she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloakthe lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marblelike bodyher left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swanin the dark fur of the sleeve while her left hand played carelesslywith the whipby chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall oppositeand i cried out for i saw the two of us in its golden frame as ina picture the picture was so marvellously beautiful so strange soimaginative that i was filled with deep sorrow at the thought thatits lines and colors would have to dissolve like mistwhat is the matter asked wandai pointed to the mirrorah that is really beautiful she exclaimed too bad one can'tcapture the moment and make it permanentand why not i asked would not any artist even the most famousbe proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal bymeans of his brushthe very thought that this extraordinary beauty is to be lost tothe world i continued still watching her enthusiastically ishorribleall this glorious facial expression this mysterious eyewith its green fires this demonic hair this magnificence of bodythe idea fills me with a horror of death of annihilation but thehand of an artist shall snatch you from this you shall not like therest of us disappear absolutely and forever without leaving a traceof your having been your picture must live even when you yourselfhave long fallen to dust your beauty must triumph beyond deathwanda smiledtoo bad that presentday italy hasn't a titian or raphael shesaid but perhaps love will make amends for genius who knows ourlittle german might do she ponderedyes he shall paint you and i will see to it that the god of lovemixes his colors    the young painter has established his studio in her villa he iscompletely in her net he has just begun a madonna a madonna withred hair and green eyes only the idealism of a german would attemptto use this thoroughbred woman as a model for a picture ofvirginity the poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than iam our misfortune is that our titania has discovered our ass's earstoo soon    now she laughs derisively at us and how she laughs i hear herinsolent melodious laughter in his studio under the open window ofwhich i stand jealously listening    are you mad meah it is unbelievable me as the mother of godshe exclaimed and laughed again wait a moment i will show youanother picture of myself one that i myself have painted and youshall copy ither head appeared in the window luminous like a flame under thesunlightgregori hurried up the stairs through the gallery into the studiolead him to the bath wanda commanded while she herself hurriedawaya few moments passed and wanda arrived dressed in nothing but thesable fur with the whip in her hand she descended the stairs andstretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion i layat her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me her right handplayed with the whip look at me she said with your deepfanatical look that's itthe painter had turned terribly pale he devoured the scene with hisbeautiful dreamy blue eyes his lips opened but he remained dumbwell how do you like the pictureyes that is how i want to paint you said the german but it wasreally not a spoken language it was the eloquent moaning theweeping of a sick soul a soul sick unto death    the charcoal outline of the painting is done the heads and fleshparts are painted in her diabolical face is already becoming visibleunder a few bold strokes life flashes in her green eyeswanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over herbreastthis picture like many of those of the venetian school issimultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a storyexplained the painter who again had become pale as deathand what will you call it she asked but what is the matter withyou are you illi am afraid he answered with a consuming look fixed on thebeautiful woman in furs but let us talk of the pictureyes let us talk about the picturei imagine the goddess of love as having descended from mount olympusfor the sake of some mortal man and always cold in this modern worldof ours she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy furand her feet in the lap of her lover i imagine the favorite of abeautiful despot who whips her slave when she is tired of kissinghim and the more she treads him underfoot the more insanely he lovesher and so i shall call the picture _venus in furs_    the painter paints slowly but his passion grows more and morerapidly i am afraid he will end up by committing suicide she playswith him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve and hefeels his blood congealing in the process but it amuses herduring the sitting she nibbles at candies and rolls the paperwrappersinto little pellets with which she bombards himi am glad you are in such good humor said the painter but your facehas lost the expression which i need for my picturethe expression which you need for your picture she repliedsmiling wait a momentshe rose and dealt me a blow with the whip the painter looked ather with stupefaction and a childlike surprise showed on his facemingled with disgust and admirationwhile whipping me wanda's face acquired more and more of the cruelcontemptuous character which so haunts and intoxicates meis this the expression you need for your picture she exclaimedthe painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of hereyeit is the expression he stammered but i can't paint nowwhat said wanda scornfully perhaps i can help youyes cried the german as if taken with madness whip me toooh with pleasure she replied shrugging her shoulders but ifi am to whip you i want to do it in sober earnestwhip me to death cried the painterwill you let me tie you she asked smilingyes he moanedwanda left the room for a moment and returned with ropeswellare you still brave enough to put yourself into the power ofvenus in furs the beautiful despot for better or worse she beganironicallyyes tie me the painter replied dully wanda tied his hands onhis back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around hisbody and fettered him to the crossbars of the window then sherolled back the fur seized the whip and stepped in front of himthe scene had a grim attraction for me which i cannot describe ifelt my heart beat when with a smile she drew back her arm for thefirst blow and the whip hissed through the air he winced slightlyunder the blow then she let blow after blow rain upon him with hermouth halfopened and her teeth flashing between her red lips untilhe finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous blue eyes itwas indescribable    she is sitting for him now alone he is working on her headshe has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtainwhere i can't be seen but can see everythingwhat does she intend nowis she afraid of him she has driven him insane enough to be sureor is she hatching a new torment for me my knees tremblethey are talking he has lowered his voice so that i cannotunderstand a word and she replies in the same way what is themeaning of this is there an understanding between themi suffer frightful torments my heart seems about to bursthe kneels down before her embraces her and presses his headagainst her breast and shein her heartlessnesslaughsand nowi hear her saying aloudah you need another application of the whipwoman goddess are you without a heartcan't you love exclaimedthe german don't you even know what it means to love to beconsumed with desire and passion can't you even imagine what isuffer have you no pity for meno she replied proudly and mockingly but i have the whipshe drew it quickly from the pocket of her furcoat and struck himin the face with the handle he rose and drew back a couple of pacesnow are you ready to paint again she asked indifferently he didnot reply but again went to the easel and took up his brush andpalettethe painting is marvellously successful it is a portrait which asfar as the likeness goes couldn't be better and at the same time itseems to have an ideal quality the colors glow are supernaturalalmost diabolical i would call themthe painter has put all his sufferings his adoration and all hisexecration into the picture    now he is painting me we are alone together for several hours everyday today he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and saidyou love this womanyesi also love her his eyes were bathed in tears he remained silentfor a while and continued paintingwe have a mountain at home in germany within which she dwells hemurmured to himself she is a demon    the picture is finished she insisted on paying him for itmunificently in the manner of queensoh you have already paid me he said with a tormented smilerefusing her offerbefore he left he secretly opened his portfolio and let me lookinside i was startled her head looked at me as if out of a mirrorand seemed actually to be alivei

magnificent specimen of man no rather he isa man whose like i have never yet seen among the living he is in thebelvedere graven in marble with the same slender yet steelymusculature with the same face

aloud that this man is my loverand that he will apply the lash to you and that you will enjoy beingpunished by himbut now go go    before evening fell i had the desired informationwanda was still

love lying on the ottoman not as slavebut as master and she at his feet on my knees i served them theteatray faltering in my hands and i saw him reach for the whipbut now the servants are talking about himhe is a man who is like a woman he knows that he is beautiful andhe acts accordingly he changes his clothes four or five times a daylike a vain courtesanin paris he appeared first in woman's dress and the men assailedhim with loveletters an italian singer famous equally for his artand his passionate intensity even invaded his home and lying on hisknees before him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldn't be hisi am sorry he replied smiling i should like to do you thefavor but you will have to carry out your threat for i am a man    the drawingroom has already thinned out to a marked degree but sheapparently has no thought of leavingmorning is already peering through the blindsat last i hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows alongbehind her like green waves she advances step by step engaged inconversation with himi hardly exist for her any longer she doesn't even trouble to giveme an orderthe cloak for madame he commands he of course doesn't think oflooking after her himselfwhile i put her furs about her he stands to one side with his armscrossed while i am on my knees putting on her fur overshoes shelightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder she asksand what about the lionesswhen the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives isattacked by another the greek went on with his narrative thelioness quietly lies down and watches the battle even if her mateis worsted she does not go to his aid she looks on indifferently ashe bleeds to death under his opponent's claws and follows the victorthe strongerthat is the female's natureat this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at meit made me shudder though i didn't know whyand the red dawnimmerses me and her and him in blood    she did not go to bed but merely threw off her balldress and undidher hair then she ordered me to build a fire and she sat by thefireplace and stared into the flamesdo you need me any longer mistress i asked my voice failed meat the last wordwanda shook her headi left the room passed through the gallery and sat down on one ofthe steps leading from there down into the garden a gentle northwind brought a fresh damp coolness from the arno the green hillsextended into the distance in a rosy mist a golden haze hovered overthe city over the round cupola of the duomoa few stars still tremble in the paleblue skyi tore open my coat and pressed my burning forehead against themarble everything that had happened so far seemed to me a merechild's play but now things were beginning to be serious terriblyseriousi anticipated a catastrophe i visualized it i could lay hold of itwith my hands but i lacked the courage to meet it my strength wasbroken and if i am honest with myself neither the pains andsufferings that threatened me not the humiliations that impendedwere the thing that frightened mei merely felt a fear the fear of losing her whom i loved with asort of fanatical devotion but it was so overwhelming so crushingthat i suddenly began to sob like a child    during the day she remained locked in her room and had the negressattend her when the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky i sawher pass through the garden and carefully following her at adistance watched her enter the shrine of venus i stealthilyfollowed and peered through the chink in the doorshe stood before the divine image of the goddess her hands foldedas in prayer and the sacred light of the star of love casts its bluerays over her    on my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took suchpowerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me ilighted the little red oillamp which hung in the corridor beneatha saint's image and entered her bedroom covering the light with onehandthe lioness had been hunted and driven

full on her wonderfulfacebut she did not awakeni gently set the lamp on the floor sank down beside wanda's bedand rested my head on her soft glowing armshe moved slightly but even now did not awaken i do not know howlong i lay thus in the middle of the night turned as into a stoneby horrible tormentsfinally a severe trembling seized me and i was able to cry mytears flowed over her arm she quivered several times and finally satup she brushed her hand across her eyes and looked at meseverin she exclaimed more frightened than angryi was unable to replyseverin she continued softly what is the matter are you illher voice sounded so sympathetic so kind so full of love that itclutched my breast like redhot tongs and i began to sob aloudseverin she began anew my poor unhappy friend her hand

of poets or on the stage but ialways thought it was a figment of the imagination oh he is a manlike a lion strong and beautiful and yet gentle not brutal like themen of our northern world i am sorry for you severin i am but imust possess him what am i saying i must give myself to him if hewill have meconsider your reputation wanda which so far has remainedspotless i exclaimed even if i no longer

eyes i murmured dullydo what you please wanda replied with complete indifference butlet me go to sleep she yawned aloud i am very sleepyfor a moment i stood as if petrified then i began to laugh and cryat the same time finally i placed the poinard in my belt and againfell on my knees before herwanda listen to me only for a few moments i beggedi want to go to sleep don't you hear she cried leaping angrilyout of bed and pushing me away with her foot you forget that i amyour mistress when i didn't budge she seized the whip and struckme i rose she struck me againthis time right in the facewretch slavewith clenched fist held heavenward i left her bedroom with a suddenresolve she tossed the whip aside and broke out into clearlaughter i can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have beenvery droll    i have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman whohas treated me so cruelly and is now about to break faith and betrayme as a reward for all my slavish devotion for everything i havesuffered from her i packed my few belongings into a bundle and thenwrote her as followsdear madami have loved you even to madness i have given myself to you as no manever has given himself to a woman you have abused my most sacredemotions and played an impudent frivolous game with me however aslong as you were merely cruel and merciless it was still possible forme to love you now you are about to become _cheap_ i am no longerthe slave whom you can kick about and whip you yourself have set mefree and i am leaving a woman i can only hate and despiseseverin kusiemskii handed these lines to the negress and hastened away as fast as icould go i arrived at the railwaystation all out of breathsuddenly i felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped i began toweep it is humiliating that i want to flee and i can't i turn backwhitherto her whom i abhor and yet at the same time adoreagain i pause i cannot go back i dare notbut how am i to leave florence i remember that i haven't any moneynot a penny very well then on foot it is better to be an honestbeggar than to eat the bread of a courtesanbut still i can't leaveshe has my pledge my word of honor i have to return perhaps shewill release meafter a few rapid strides i stop againshe has my word of honor and my bond that i shall remain her slaveas long as she desires until she herself gives me my freedom buti might kill myselfi go through the cascine down to the arno where its yellow watersplash monotonously about a couple of stray willows there i sit andcast up my final accounts with existence i let my entire life passbefore me in review on the whole it is rather a wretched affairafew joys an endless number of indifferent and worthless things andbetween these an abundant harvest of pains miseries fearsdisappointments shipwrecked hopes afflictions sorrow and griefi thought of my mother whom i loved so deeply and whom i had towatch waste away beneath a horrible disease of my brother who fullof the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youthwithout even having put his lips to the cup of life i thought of mydead nurse my childhood playmates the friends that had striven andstudied with me of all those covered by the cold dead indifferentearth i thought of my turtledove who not infrequently made hiscooing bows to me instead of to his mateall have returned dustunto dusti laughed aloud and slid down into the water but at the samemoment i caught hold of one of the willowbranches hanging above theyellow waves as in a vision i see the woman who has caused all mymisery she hovers above the level of the water luminous in thesunlight as though she were transparent with red flames about herhead and neck she turns her face toward me and smiles    i am back again dripping wet through glowing with shame andfever the negress has delivered my letter i am judged lost in thepower of a heartless affronted womanwell let her kill me i am unable to do it myself and yet i haveno wish to go on livingas i walk around the house she is standing in the gallery leaningover the railing her face is full in the light of the sun and hergreen eyes sparklestill alive she asked without moving i stood silent with bowedheadgive me back my poinard she continued it is of no use to youyou haven't even the courage to take your own lifei have lost it i replied trembling shaken by chillsshe looked me over with a proud scornful glancei suppose you lost it in the arno she shrugged her shoulders nomatter well and why didn't you leavei mumbled something which neither she nor i myself could understandoh you haven't any money she cried here with anindescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her pursei did not pick it upboth of us were silent for some timeyou don't want to leave theni can't    wanda drives in the cascine without me and goes to the theaterwithout me she receives company and the negress serves her no oneasks after me i stray about the garden irresolutely like an animalthat has lost its masterlying among the bushes i watch a couple of sparrows fighting overa seedsuddenly i hear the swish of a woman's dresswanda approaches in a gown of dark silk modestly closed up to theneck the greek is with her they are in an eager discussion but icannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying he stampshis foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions and helashes the air with his riding whip wanda startlesis she afraid that he will strike herhave they gone that farhe has left her she calls him he does not hear her does not wantto hear herwanda sadly lowers her head and then sits down on the neareststonebench she sits for a long time lost in thought i watch her witha sort of malevolent pleasure finally i pull myself together by sheerforce of will and ironically step before her she startles andtrembles all overi come to wish you happiness i said bowing i see my dearlady too has found a masteryes thank god she exclaimed not a new slave i have had

arnobut you saved me i replied tenderly you hovered over thewaters and smiled and your smile called me back to life    i have a curious feeling when i now hold her in my arms and she liessilently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles i feellike one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium orlike a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves thatmomentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safeshore    i hate this florence where you have been so unhappy shedeclared as i was saying goodnight to her i want to leaveimmediately tomorrow you

woman    early in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how i had slepther tenderness is positively wonderful i should never have believedthat she could be so tender    she has now been gone for over four hours i have long sincefinished the letters and am now sitting in the gallery looking downthe street to see whether i cannot discover her carriage in thedistance i am a little worried about her and yet i know there isno reason under heaven why i should doubt or fear however a feelingof oppression weighs me down and i cannot rid myself of it it isprobably the sufferings of the past days which still cast theirshadows into my soul    she is back radiant with happiness and contentmentwell has everything gone as you wished i asked tenderly kissingher handyes dear heart she replied and we shall leave tonight helpme pack my trunks    toward evening she asked me to go to the postoffice and mail herletters myself i took her carriage and was back within an hourmistress has asked for you said the negress with a grin as iascended the wide marble stairshas anyone been hereno one she replied crouching down on the steps like a black cati slowly passed through the drawingroom and then stood before herbedroom doorwhy does my heart beat so am i not perfectly happyopening the door softly i draw back the portiere wanda is lying onthe ottoman and does not seem to notice me how beautiful she looksin her silvergray dress which fits closely and while displayingin telltale fashion her splendid figure leaves her wonderful bustand arms bareher hair is interwoven with and held up by a black velvet ribbona mighty fire is burning in the fireplace the hanging lamp castsa reddish glow and the whole room is as if drowned in bloodwanda i said at lastoh severin she cried out joyously i have been impatientlywaiting for you she leaped up and folded me in her arms she satdown again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to herside but i softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in herlapdo you know i am very much in love with you today she whisperedbrushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyeshow beautiful your eyes are i have always loved them as the bestof you but today they fairly intoxicate me i am all sheextended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneathher red lashesand youyou are coldyou hold me like a block of wood wait i'llstir you with the fire of love she said and again clung fawninglyand caressingly to my lipsi no longer please you i suppose i'll have to be cruel to youagain evidently i have been too kind to you today do you know youlittle fool what i shall do i shall whip you for a whilebut childi want towandacome let me bind you she continued and ran gaily through theroom i want to see you very much in love do you understand hereare the ropes i wonder if i can still do itshe began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behindmy back pinioning my arms like those of a prisonerso she said with gay eagerness can you still movenofineshe then tied a noose in a stout rope threw it over my head andlet it slip down as far as the hips she drew it tight and bound meto a pillara curious tremor seized me at that momenti have a feeling as if i were about to be executed i said with alow voicewell you shall have a thorough punishment today exclaimed wandabut put on your furjacket please i saidi shall gladly give you that pleasure she replied she got her_kazabaika_ and put it on then she stood in front of me withher arms folded across her chest and looked at me out of halfclosedeyesdo you remember the story of the ox of dionysius she askedi remember it only vaguely what about ita courtier invented a new implement of torture for the tyrant ofsyracuse it was an iron ox in which those condemned to death wereto be shut and then pushed into a mighty furnaceas soon as the iron ox began to get hot and the condemned personbegan to cry out in his torment his wails sounded like the bellowingof an oxdionysius nodded graciously to the inventor and to put hisinvention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron oxit is a very instructive storyit was you who innoculated me with selfishness pride and crueltyand _you shall be their first victim_ i now literally enjoy having ahuman being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my poweri love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than iespecially a man who loves medo you still love meeven to madness i exclaimedso much the better she replied and so much the more will youenjoy what i am about to do with you nowwhat is the matter with you i asked i don't understand youthere is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes today and you arestrangely beautifulcompletely _venus in furs_without replying wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed mei was again seized by my fanatical passionwhere is the whip i askedwanda laughed and withdrew a couple of stepsyou really insist upon being punished she exclaimed proudlytossing back her headyessuddenly wanda's face was completely transformed it was as ifdisfigured by rage for a moment she seemed even ugly to mevery well then _you_ whip him she called loudlyat the same instant the beautiful greek stuck his head of blackcurls through the curtains of her fourposter bed at first i wasspeechless petrified there was a horribly comic element in thesituation i would have laughed aloud had not my position been atthe same time so terribly cruel and humiliatingit went beyond anything i had imagined a cold shudder ran down myback when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots histightfitting white breeches and his short velvet jacket and i sawhis athletic limbsyou are indeed cruel he said turning to wandaonly inordinately fond of pleasure she replied with a wild sortof humor pleasure alone lends value to existence whoever enjoysdoes not easily part from life whoever suffers or is needy meetsdeath like a friendbut whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of theancient world he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of othershe must never feel pity he must be ready to harness others to hiscarriage or his plough as though they were animals he must know how tomake slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does and use them forhis service and pleasure without remorse it is not his affair whetherthey like it or whether they go to rack and ruin he must alwaysremember this that if they had him in their power as he has them theywould act in exactly the same way and he would have to pay for theirpleasure with his sweat and blood and soul that was the world of theancients pleasure and cruelty liberty and slavery went hand in handpeople who want to live like the gods of olympus must of necessity haveslaves whom they can toss into their fishponds and gladiators who willdo battle the while they banquet and they must not mind if by chance abit of blood bespatters themher words brought back my complete selfpossessionunloosen me i exclaimed angrilyaren't you my slave my property replied wanda do you want meto show you the agreementuntie me i threatened otherwise i tugged at the ropescan he tear himself free she asked he has threatened to kill mebe entirely at ease said the greek testing my fettersi shall call for help i began againno one will hear you replied wanda and no one will hinder mefrom abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous gamewith you she continued repeating with satanic mockery phrases frommy letter to herdo you think i am at this moment merely cruel and merciless or ami also about to become cheap what do you still love me or do youalready hate and despise me here is the whip she handed it to thegreek who quickly stepped closerdon't you dare i exclaimed trembling with indignation i won'tpermit itoh because i don't wear furs the greek replied with an ironicalsmile and he took his short sable from the bedyou are adorable exclaimed wanda kissing him and helping himinto his fursmay i really whip him he askeddo with him what you please replied wandabeast i exclaimed utterly revoltedthe greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out thewhip his muscles swelled when he drew back his arms and made thewhip hiss through the air i was bound like marsyas while apollo wasgetting ready to flay memy look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceilingwhere samson lying at delilah's feet was about to have his eyes putout by the philistines the picture at that moment seemed to me likea symbol an eternal parable of passion and lust of the love of manfor woman each one of us in the end is a samson i thought andultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loveswhether he wears an ordinary coat or sablesnow watch me break him in said the greek he showed his teethand his face acquired the bloodthirsty expression which startledme the first time i saw himand he began to apply the lashso mercilessly with such frightfulforce that i quivered under each blow and began to tremble all overwith pain tears rolled down over my cheeks in the meantime wandalay on the ottoman in her furjacket supporting herself on her armshe looked on with cruel curiosity and was convulsed with laughterthe sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyesof an adored woman cannot be described i almost went mad with shameand despairwhat was most humiliating was that at first i felt a certain wildsupersensual stimulation under apollo's whip and the cruel laughterof my venus no matter how horrible my position was but apollowhipped on and on blow after blow until i forgot all about poetryand finally gritted my teeth in impotent rage and cursed my wilddreams woman and loveall of a sudden i saw with horrible clarity whither blind passionand lust have led man ever since holofernes and agamemnoninto ablind alley into the net of woman's treachery into misery slaveryand deathit was as though i were awakening from a dreamblood was already flowing under the whip i wound like a worm thatis trodden on but he whipped on without mercy and she continued tolaugh without mercy in the meantime she locked her packed trunk andslipped into her travelling furs and was still laughing when shewent downstairs on his arm and entered the carriagethen everything was silent for a momenti listened breathlesslythe carriage door slammed the horse began to pullthe rolling ofthe carriage for a short timethen all was over    for a moment i thought of taking vengeance of killing him but iwas bound by the abominable agreement so nothing was left for me todo except to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth    my first impulse after this the most cruel catastrophe of my lifewas to seek laborious tasks dangers and privations i wanted tobecome a soldier and go to asia or algiers but my father was old andill and wanted meso i quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear hisburdens and learned how to look after the estate which i had neverdone before to _labor_ and to _do my duty_ was comforting like adrink of fresh water then my father died and i inherited the estatebut it meant no changei had put on my own spanish boots and went on living just asrationally as if the old man were standing behind me looking overmy shoulder with his large wise eyesone day a box arrived accompanied by a letter i recognized wanda'swritingcuriously moved i opened it and readsirnow that over three years have passed since that night in florencei suppose i may confess to you that i loved you deeply youyourself however stifled my love by your fantastic devotion andyour insane passion from the moment that you became my slave i knewit would be impossible for you ever to become my husband howeveri found it interesting to have you realize your ideal in my own personand while i gloriously amused myself perhaps to cure youi found the strong man for whom i felt a need and i was as happywith him as i suppose it is possible for any one to be on thisfunny ball of claybut my happiness like all things mortal was of short durationabout a year ago he fell in a duel and since then i have been livingin paris like an aspasiaand youyour life surely is not without its sunshine if you havegained control of your imagination and those qualities in you havematerialized which at first so attracted me to youyour clarity ofintellect kindness of heart and above all else your_moralseriousness_i hope you have been cured under my whip the cure was cruel butradical in memory of that time and of a woman who loved youpassionately i am sending you the portrait by the poor german_venus in furs_i had to smile and as i fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenlystood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine with thewhip in her hand and i continued to smile at the woman i had onceloved so insanely at the furjacket that had once so entranced meat the whip and ended by smiling at myself and saying the cure wascruel but radical but the main point is i have been cured    and the moral of the story i said to severin when i put themanuscript down on the tablethat i was a donkey he exclaimed without turning around for heseemed to be embarrassed if only i had beaten hera curious remedy i exclaimed which might answer with yourpeasantwomenoh they are used to it he replied eagerly but imagine theeffect upon one of our delicate nervous hysterical ladiesbut the moralthat woman as nature has created her and as man is at presenteducating her is his enemy she can only be his slave or his despotbut _never his companion_ this she can become only when she hasthe same rights as he and is his equal in education and workat present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil and iwas the kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him do youunderstandthe moral of the tale is this whoever allows himself to bewhipped deserves to be whippedthe blows as you see have agreed with me the roseate supersensualmist has dissolved and no one can ever make me believe again thatthese 'sacred apes of benares'  or plato's rooster  are the image of godend of project

"Arabian Nights, Vol. 7 (Chap. 16)",Richard F. Burton,arabian nights vol  chap  lyricsardashir and hayat alnufusthere was once in the city of shrz a mighty king called sayf ala'azam shah who had grown old without being blessed with a son so he summoned the physicists and physicians and said to them i am now in years and ye know my case and the state of the kingdom and its ordinance and i fear for my subjects after me for that up to this present i have not been vouchsafed a son thereupon they replied we will compound thee a somewhat of drugs wherein shall be efficacy if it please almighty allah so they mixed him drugs which he used and knew his wife carnally and she conceived by leave of the most high lord who saith to a thing be and it becometh when her months were accomplished she gave birth to a male child like the moon whom his father named ardashir and he grew up and throve and applied himself to the study of learning and letters till he attained the age of fifteen now there was in alirak a king called abd alkdir who had a daughter by name hayt alnufs and she was like the rising full moon but she had an hatred for men and the folk very hardly dared name mankind in her presence the kings of the chosros had sought her in marriage of her sire but when he spoke with her thereof she said never will i do this and if thou force me thereto i will slay myself now prince ardashir heard of her fame and fell in love with her and told his father who seeing his case took pity on him and promised him day by day that he should marry her so he despatched his wazir to demand her in wedlock but king abd alkadir refused and when the minister returned to king sayf ala'azam and acquainted him with what had befallen his mission and the failure thereof he was wroth with exceeding wrath and cried shall the like of me send to one of the kings on a requisition and he accomplish it not then he bade a herald make proclamation to his troops bidding them bring out the tents and equip them for war with all diligence though they should borrow money for the necessary expenses and he said i will on no wise turn back till i have laid waste king abd alkadir's dominions and slain his men and plundered his treasures and blotted out his traces when the report of this reached ardashir he rose from his carpetbed and going in to his father kissed ground between his hands and said o mighty king trouble not thyself with aught of this thingand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentieth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when report of this reached the prince he went in to his sire the king and kissing ground between his hands said o mighty king trouble not thy soul with aught of this thing and levy not thy champions and armies neither spend thy monies thou art stronger than he and if thou loose upon him this thy host thou wilt lay waste his cities and dominions and spoil his good and slay his strong men and himself but when his daughter shall come to know what hath befallen her father and his people by reason of her she will slay herself and i shall die on her account for i can never live after her no never asked the king and what then thinkest thou to do o my son and the prince answered i will don a merchant's habit and cast about how i may win to the princess and compass my desire of her quoth sayf ala'azam art thou determined upon this and quoth the prince yes o my sire whereupon the king called to his wazir and said to him do thou journey with my son the core of my heart and help him to win his will and watch over him and guide him with thy sound judgment for thou standest to him even in my stead i hear and obey answered the minister and the king gave his son three hundred thousand dinars in gold and great store of jewels and precious stones and goldsmiths' ware and stuffs and other things of price then prince ardashir went in to his mother and kissed her hands and asked her blessing she blessed him and forthright opening her treasures brought out to him necklaces and trinkets and apparel and all manner of other costly objects hoarded up from the time of the bygone kings whose price might not be evened with coin moreover he took with him of his mamelukes and negroslaves and cattle all that he needed for the road and clad himself and the wazir and their company in traders' gear then he farewelled his parents and kinsfolk and friends and setting out fared on over wolds and wastes all hours of the day and watches of the night and whenas the way was longsome upon him he improvised these coupletsmy longing bred of love with mine unease for ever grows nbsp nor against all the wrongs of time one succourer arosewhen pleiads and the fishes show in sky the rise i watch  asnbsp worshipper within whose breast a pious burning glowsfor star o' morn i speer until at last when it is seen  i'mnbsp madded with my passion and my fancy's woes and throesi swear by you that never from your love have i been loosed nbsp naught am i save a watcher who of slumber nothing knowsthough hard appear my hope to win though languor ayenbsp increase  and after thee my patience fails and ne'er anbsp helper showsyet will i wait till allah shall be pleased to join our lovesnbsp  i'll mortify the jealous and i'll mock me of my foeswhen he ended his verse he swooned away and the wazir sprinkled rosewater on him till the prince came to himself when the minister said to him o king's son possess thy soul in patience for the consequence of patience is consolation and behold thou art on the way to whatso thou wishest and he ceased not to bespeak him fair and comfort him till his trouble subsided and they continued their journey with all diligence presently the prince again became impatient of the length of the way and bethought him of his beloved and recited these coupletslongsome is absence restlessness increaseth and despite nbsp and burn my vitals in the blaze my love and longingsnbsp lightgrows my hair gray from pains and pangs which i am doomed bearnbsp  for pine while tearfloods stream from eyes and sorenbsp offend my sighti swear o hope of me o end of every wish and will  by himnbsp who made mankind and every branch with leafage dighta passionload for thee o my desire i must endure  andnbsp boast i that to bear such load no lover hath the mightquestion the night of me and night thy soul shall satisfy nbsp mine eyelids never close in sleep throughout the livelongnbsp nightthen he wept with sore weeping and 'plained of that he suffered for stress of lovelonging but the wazir comforted him and spoke him fair promising him the winning of his wish after which they fared on again for a few days when they drew near to the white city the capital of king abd alkadir soon after sunrise then said the minister to the prince rejoice o king's son in all good for see yonder is the white city that which thou seekest whereat the prince rejoiced with exceeding joy and recited these coupletsmy friends i yearn in heart distraught for him  longingnbsp abides and with sore pains i brimi mourn like childless mother nor can find  one tonbsp console me when the light grows dimyet when the breezes blow from off thy land  i feelnbsp their freshness shed on heart and limband rail mine eyes like waterladen clouds  while in anbsp tearsea shed by heart i swimnow when they entered the white city they asked for the merchants' khan a place of moneyed men and when shown the hostelry they hired three magazines and on receiving the keys they laid up therein all their goods and gear they abode in the khan till they were rested when the wazir applied himself to devise a device for the princeand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentyfirst nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the prince and the minister alighted at the khan and lodged their goods in the groundfloor magazines and there settled their servants then they tarried awhile till they had rested when the wazir arose and applied himself to devise a device for the prince and said to him i have bethought me of somewhat wherein methinks will be success for thee so it please almighty allah quoth ardashir o thou wazir of good counsel do what cometh to thy mind and may the lord direct thy rede aright quoth the minister i purpose to hire thee a shop in the marketstreet of the stuffsellers and set thee therein for that all great and small have recourse to the bazar and meseems when the folk see thee with their own eyes sitting in the shop their hearts will incline to thee and thou wilt thus be enabled to attain thy desire for thou art fair of favour and souls incline to thee and sight rejoiceth in thee the other replied do what seemeth good to thee so the wazir forthright began to robe the prince and himself in their richest raiment and putting a purse of a thousand dinars in his breastpocket went forth and walked about the city whilst all who looked upon them marvelled at the beauty of the king's son saying glory be to him who created this youth 'of vile water' blessed be allah excellentest of creators great was the talk anent him and some said this is no mortal 'this is naught save a noble angel' and others hath rizwan the doorkeeper of the edengarden left the gate of paradise unguarded that this youth hath come forth the people followed them to the stuff market where they entered and stood till there came up to them an old man of dignified presence and venerable appearance who saluted them and they returned his salam then the shaykh said to them o my lords have ye any need that we may have the honour of accomplishing and the wazir asked him who art thou o elder he answered i am the overseer of the market quoth the wazir know then o shaykh that this youth is my son and i wish to hire him a shop in the bazar that he may sit therein and learn to sell and buy and take and give and come to ken merchants' ways and habits i hear and i obey replied the overseer and brought them without stay or delay the key of a shop which he caused the brokers sweep and clean and they did his bidding then the wazir sent for a high mattress stuffed with ostrichdown and set it up in the shop spreading upon it a small prayercarpet and a cushion fringed with broidery of red gold moreover he brought pillows and transported thither so much of the goods and stuffs that he had brought with him as filled the shop next morning the young prince came and opening the shop seated himself on the divan and stationed two mamelukes clad in the richest of raiment before him and two black slaves of the goodliest of the abyssinians in the lower part of the shop the wazir enjoined him to keep his secret from the folk so thereby he might find aid in the winning of his wishes then he left him and charging him to acquaint him with what befel him in the shop day by day returned to the khan the prince sat in the shop till night as he were the moon at its fullest whilst the folk hearing tell of his comeliness flocked to the place without errand to gaze on his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace and glorify the almighty who created and shaped him till none could pass through that bazar for the excessive crowding of the folk about him the king's son turned right and left abashed at the throng of people that stared at him hoping to make acquaintance with some one about the court of whom he might get news of the princess but he found no way to this wherefore his breast was straitened meanwhile the wazir daily promised him the attainment of his desire and the case so continued for a time till one morning as the youth sat in the shop there came up an old woman of respectable semblance and dignified presence clad in raiment of devotees and followed by two slavegirls like moons she stopped before the shop and having considered the prince awhile cried glory be to god who fashioned that face and perfected that figure then she saluted him and he returned her salam and seated her by his side quoth she whence cometh thou o fair of favour and quoth he from the parts of hind o my mother and i have come to this city to see the world and look about me honour to thee for a visitor what goods and stuffs hast thou show me something handsome fit for kings if thou wish for handsome stuffs i will show them to thee for i have wares that beseem persons of every condition o my son i want somewhat costly of price and seemly to sight brief the best thou hast thou must needs tell me for whom thou seekest it that i may show thee goods according to the rank of the requiter thou speakest sooth o my son said she i want somewhat for my mistress hayat alnufus daughter of abd alkadir lord of this land and king of this country now when ardashir heard his mistress's name his reason flew for joy and his heart fluttered and he gave no order to slave or servant but putting his hand behind him pulled out a purse of an hundred dinars and offered it to the old woman saying this is for the washing of thy clothes then he again put forth his hand and brought out of a wrapper a dress worth ten thousand dinars or more and said to her this is of that which i have brought to your country when the old woman saw it it pleased her and she asked what is the price of this dress o perfect in qualities answered he i will take no price for it whereupon she thanked him and repeated her question but he said by allah i will take no price for it i make thee a present of it an the princess will not accept it and 'tis a guestgift from me to thee alham dolillahglory be to godwho hath brought us together so that if one day i have a want i shall find in thee a helper to me in winning it she marvelled at the goodliness of his speech and the excess of his generosity and the perfection of his courtesy and said to him what is thy name o my lord he replied my name is ardashir and she cried by allah this is a rare name therewith are kings' sons named and thou art in a guise of the sons of the merchants quoth he of the love my father bore me he gave me this name but a name signifieth naught and quoth she in wonder o my son take the price of thy goods but he swore that he would not take aught then the old lady said to him o my dear one truth i would have thee know is the greatest of all things and thou hadst not dealt thus generously by me but for a special reason so tell me thy case and thy secret thought belike thou hast some wish to whose winning i may help thee thereupon he laid his hand in hers and after exacting an oath of secrecy told her the whole story of his passion for the princess and his condition by reason thereof the old woman shook her head and said true but o my son the wise say in the current adage 'an thou wouldest be obeyed abstain from ordering what may not be made' and thou my son thy name is merchant and though thou hadst the keys of the hidden hoards yet wouldst thou be called naught but merchant an thou wouldst rise to high rank according to thy station then seek the hand of a kazi's daughter or even an emir's but why o my son aspirest thou to none but the daughter of the king of the age and the time and she a clean maid who knoweth nothing of the things of the world and hath never in her life seen anything but her palace wherein she dwelleth yet for all her tender age she is intelligent shrewd vivacious penetrating quick of wit sharp of act and rare of rede her father hath no other child and she is dearer to him than his life and soul every morning he cometh to her and giveth her goodmorrow and all who dwell in the palace stand in dread of her think not o my son that any dare bespeak her with aught of these words nor is there any way for me thereto by allah o my son my heart and vitals love thee and were it in my power to give thee access to her i would assuredly do it but i will tell thee somewhat wherein allah may haply appoint the healing of thy heart and will risk life and goods for thee till i win thy will for thee he asked and what is that o my mother and she answered seek of me the daughter of a wazir or an emir and i will grant thy request but it may not be that one should mount from earth to heaven at one bound when the prince heard this he replied to her with courtesy and sense o my mother thou art a woman of wit and knowest how things go say me doth a man when his head irketh him bind up his hand quoth she no by allah o my son and quoth he even so my heart seeketh none but her and naught slayeth me but love of her by allah i am a dead man and i find not one to counsel me aright and succour me allah upon thee o my mother take pity on my strangerhood and the streaming of my tearsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentysecond nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that ardashir the king's son said to the old woman allah upon thee o my mother take pity on my strangerhood and the streaming of my tears replied she by allah o my son thy words rend my heart but my hand hath no cunning wherewith to help thee quoth he i beseech thee of thy favour carry her a letter and kiss her hands for me so she had compassion on him and said write what thou wilt and i will bear it to her when he heard this he was ready to fly for joy and calling for inkcase and paper wrote these coupletso hayt alnfus be gen'rous and incline  to one whonbsp loving thee for parting's doomed to pinei was in all delight in gladsomest of life  but now i amnbsp distraught with sufferings condignto wakefulness i cling through longsomeness of night  andnbsp with me sorrow chats through each sad eye ofnbsp minepity a lover sad a sore afflicted wretch  whose eyelidsnbsp ever ulcered are with tearful brineand when the morning comes at last the real morn  he findsnbsp him drunken and distraught with passion's winethen he folded the scroll and kissing it gave it to the old woman after which he put his hand to a chest and took out a second purse containing an hundred dinars which he presented to her saying divide this among the slavegirls she refused it and cried by allah o my son i am not with thee for aught of this however he thanked her and answered there is no help but that thou accept of it so she took it and kissing his hands returned home and going in to the princess cried o my lady i have brought thee somewhat the like whereof is not with the people of our city and it cometh from a handsome young man than whom there is not a goodlier on earth's face she asked o my nurse and whence cometh the youth and the old woman answered from the parts of hind and he hath given me this dress of gold brocade embroidered with pearls and gems and worth the kingdom of chosroes and caesar thereupon she opened the dress and the whole palace was illuminated by its brightness because of the beauty of its fashion and the wealth of unions and jewels wherewith it was broidered and all who were present marvelled at it the princess examined it and judging it to be worth no less than a whole year's revenue of her father's kingdom said to the old woman o my nurse cometh this dress from him or from another replied she from him and hayat alnufus asked is this trader of our town or a stranger the old woman answered he is a foreigner o my lady newly come hither and by allah he hath servants and slaves and he is fair of face symmetrical of form well mannered openhanded and openhearted never saw i a goodlier than he save thyself the king's daughter rejoined indeed this is an extraordinary thing that a dress like this which money cannot buy should be in the hands of a merchant what price did he set on it o my nurse quoth she by allah he would set no price on it but gave me back the money thou sentest by me and swore that he would take naught thereof saying ''tis a gift from me to the king's daughter for it beseemeth none but her and if she will not accept it i make thee a present of it' cried the princess by allah this is indeed marvellous generosity and wondrous munificence but i fear the issue of his affair lest haply he be brought to necessity why didst thou not ask him o my nurse if he had any desire that we might fulfil it for him the nurse replied o my lady i did ask him and he said to me 'i have indeed a desire' but he would not tell me what it was however he gave me this letter and said 'carry it to the princess' so hayat alnufus took the letter and opened and read it to the end whereupon she was sore chafed and lost temper and changing colour for anger she cried out to the old woman saying woe to thee o nurse what is the name of this dog who durst write this language to a king's daughter what affinity is there between me and this hound that he should address me thus by almighty allah lord of the well zemzem and of the hatim wall but that i fear the omnipotent the most high i would send and bind the cur's hands behind him and slit his nostrils and shear off his nose and ears and after by way of example crucify him on the gate of the bazar wherein is his booth when the old woman heard these words she waxed yellow her sidemuscles quivered and her tongue clave to her mouth but she heartened her heart and said softly o my lady what is there in his letter to trouble thee thus is it aught but a memorial containing his complaint to thee of poverty or oppression from which he hopeth to be relieved by thy favour replied she no by allah o my nurse 'tis naught of this but verses and shameful words however o my nurse this dog must be in one of three cases either he is jinnmad and hath no wit or he seeketh his own slaughter or else he is assisted to his wish of me by some one of exceeding puissance and a mighty sultan or hath he heard that i am one of the baggages of the city who lie a night or two with whosoever seeketh them that he writeth me immodest verses to debauch my reason by talking of such matters rejoined the old woman by allah o my lady thou sayst sooth but reck not thou of yonder ignorant hound for thou art seated in thy lofty firmbuilded and unapproachable palace to which the very birds cannot soar neither the wind pass over it and as for him he is clean distraught wherefore do thou write him a letter and chide him angrily and spare him no manner of reproof but threaten him with dreadful threats and menace him with death and say to him 'whence hast thou knowledge of me that thou durst write me o dog of a merchant o thou who trudgest far and wide all thy days in wilds and wolds for the sake of gaining a dirham or a dinar by allah except thou awake from thy sleep and put off thine intoxication i will assuredly crucify thee on the gate of the marketstreet wherein is thy shop' quoth the princess i fear lest he presume if i write to him and quoth the nurse and pray what is he and what is his rank that he should presume to us indeed we write him but to the intent that his presumption may be cut off and his fear magnified and she ceased not craftily to persuade

ardashir's shop delivered it to him and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentythird nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the old woman took that letter from hayat alnufus she fared forth till she found the youth who was sitting in his shop and gave it to him saying read thine answer and know that when she perused thy paper she was wroth with exceeding wrath but i soothed her and spake her fair till she consented to write thee a reply he took the letter joyfully but when he had read it and understood its drift he wept sore whereat the old woman's heart ached and she cried o my son allah never cause thine eyes to weep nor thy heart to mourn what can be more gracious than that she should answer thy letter when thou hast done what thou diddest he replied o my mother what shall i do for a subtle device behold she writeth to me threatening me with death and crucifixion and forbidding me

them so she took them both and said needs must i bring thee to thy desire despite the noses of thy foes then she repaired to the palace and gave the letter to hayat alnufus who said what is this o my nurse here are we in a correspondence and thou coming and going indeed i fear lest the matter get wind and we be disgraced rejoined the old woman how so o my lady who dare speak such word so she took the letter and after reading and understanding it she smote hand on hand saying verily this is a calamity which is fallen upon us and i know not whence this young man came to us quoth the old woman o my lady allah upon thee write him another letter but be rough with him this time and say to him 'an thou write me another word after this i will have thy head struck off' quoth the princess o my nurse i am assured that the matter will not end on such wise 'twere better to break off this exchange of letters and except the puppy take warning by my previous threats i will strike off his head the old

thanked him and kissed his hands after which she returned to the palace and gave the letter to the princess who took it and read it and throwing it from her fingers sprang to her feet then she walked shod as she was with pattens of gold set with pearls and jewels till she came to her sire's palace whilst the vein of anger started out between her eyes and none dared ask her of her case when she reached the palace she enquired for the king and the slavegirls and concubines replied to her o my lady he is gone forth ahunting and sporting so she returned as she were a rending lioness and bespake none for the space of three hours when her brow cleared and her wrath cooled as soon as the old woman saw that her irk and anger were past she went up to her and kissing ground between her hands asked her o my lady whither went those noble steps the princess answered to the palace of the king my sire and could no one do thine errand enquired the nurse replied the princess no for i went to acquaint him of that which hath befallen me with yonder cur of a merchant so he might lay hands on him and on all the merchants of his bazar and crucify them over their shops nor suffer a single foreign merchant to tarry in our town quoth the old woman and was this thine only reason o my lady for going to thy sire and quoth hayat alnufus yes but i found him absent ahunting and sporting and now i await his return cried the old nurse i take refuge with allah the all hearing the all knowing praised be he o my lady thou art the most sensible of women and how couldst thou think of telling the king these fond words which it behoveth none to publish asked the princess and why so and the nurse answered suppose thou had found the king in his palace and told him all this tale and he had sent after the merchants and commanded to hang them over their shops the folk would have seen them hanging and asked the reason and it would have been answered them 'they sought to seduce the king's daughter' and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentyfourth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the old woman said to the princess suppose thou had told this to the king and he had ordered the merchants to be hanged would not folk have seen them and have asked the cause of the execution when the answer would have been 'they sought to seduce the king's daughter' then would they have dispread divers reports concerning thee some saying 'she abode with them ten days away from her palace till they had taken their fill of her' and other some in otherguise for woman's honour o my lady is like ourded milk the least dust fouleth it and like glass which if it be cracked may not be mended so beware of telling thy sire or any other of this matter lest thy fair fame be smirched o mistress mine for 'twill never profit thee to tell folk aught no never weigh what i say with thy keen wit and if thou find it not just do whatso thou wilt the princess pondered her words and seeing them to be altogether profitable and right said thou speaketh sooth o my nurse but anger had blinded my judgment quoth the old woman thy resolve to tell no one is pleasing to the almighty but something remaineth to be done we must not let the shamelessness of yonder vile dog of a merchant pass without notice write him a letter and say to him 'o vilest of traders but that i found the king my father absent i had straightway commanded to hang thee and all thy neighbours but thou shalt gain nothing by this for i swear to thee by allah the most high that an thou return to the like of this talk i will blot out the trace of thee from the face of earth' and deal thou roughly with him in words so shalt thou discourage him in this attempt and arouse him from his heedlessness and will these words cause him to abstain from his offending asked the princess and the old woman answered how should he not abstain besides i will talk with him and tell him what hath passed so the princess called for inkcase and paper and wrote these coupletsto win our favours still thy hopes are bent  and stillnbsp to win thy will art

returned to the youth and when salams had been exchanged she gave him the letter he read it and shook his head saying verily we are allah's and unto him shall we return adding o my mother what shall i do my fortitude faileth me and my patience palleth upon me she replied o my son be long suffering peradventure after this allah shall bring somewhat to pass write that which is in thy mind and i will

whole and returning to the palace sought the princess to whom she gave the letter but the king's daughter refused to take it and cried what is this replied the old woman o my lady this is only the answer to the letter thou sentest to that merchant dog quoth hayat alnufus didst thou forbid him as i told thee and quoth she yes and this is his reply so the princess took the letter and read it to the end then she turned to the old woman and exclaimed where is the result of thy promise o my lady saith he not in his letter that he repenteth and will not again offend excusing himself for the past not so by allah on the contrary he increaseth o my lady write him a letter and thou shalt presently see what i will do with him there needeth nor letter nor answer i must have a letter that i may

the last he knew that she had not softened to him but only redoubled in rage against him and that he would never win to meet her so he bethought himself to write her an answer invoking allah's help against her thereupon he indited these coupletso lord by the five shaykhs i pray deliver me  from lovenbsp which gars me bear such grief and miserythou knowest what i bear for passion's fiery flame

and gave it to the old woman adding a purse of five hundred dinars and she took it and carried it to the princess who read it to the end and learned its purport then casting it from her hand she cried tell me o wicked old woman the cause of all that hath befallen me from thee and from thy cunning and thine advocacy of him so that thou hast made me write letter after letter and thou ceasest not to carry messages going and coming between us twain till thou hast brought about a correspondence and a connection thou leavest not to say 'i will ensure thee against his mischief and cut off from thee his speech' but thou speakest not thus save only to the intent that i may continue to write thee letters and thou to fetch and carry between us evening and morning till thou ruin my repute woe to thee ho eunuchs seize her then hayat alnufus commanded them to beat her and they lashed her till her whole body flowed with blood and she fainted away whereupon the king's daughter caused her slavewomen to drag her forth by the feet and cast her without the palace and bade one of them stand by her head till she recovered and say to her the princess hath sworn an oath that thou shalt never return to and reenter this palace and she hath commanded to slay thee without mercy an thou dare return hither so when she came to herself the damsel told her what the king's daughter said and she answered hearkening and obedience presently the slavegirls fetched a basket and a porter whom they caused carry her to her own house and they sent after her a physician bidding him tend her assiduously till she recovered he did what he was told to do and as soon as she was whole she mounted and rode to the shop of ardashir who was concerned with sore concern for her absence and was longing for news of her as soon as he saw her he sprang up and coming to meet her saluted her then he noticed that she was weak and ailing so he questioned her of her case and she told him all that had befallen her from her nursling when he heard this he found it grievous and smote hand upon hand saying by allah o my mother this that hath betided thee straiteneth my heart but what o my mother is the reason of the princess's hatred to men replied the old woman thou must know o my son that she hath a beautiful garden than which there is naught goodlier on earth's face and it chanced that she lay there one night in the joyance of sleep she dreamt a dream and 'twas this that she went down into the garden where she saw a fowler set up his net and strew corn thereabout after which he withdrew and sat down afar off to await what game should fall into it ere an hour had passed the birds flocked to pick up the corn and a male pigeon fell into the net and struggled in it whereat all the others took fright and fled from him his mate was amongst them but she returned to him after the shortest delay and coming up to the net sought out the mesh wherein his foot was entangled and ceased not to peck at it with her bill till she severed it and released her husband with whom she flew away all this while the fowler sat dozing and when he awoke he looked at the net and found it spoilt so he mended it and strewed fresh grain then withdrew to a distance and sat down to watch it again the birds soon returned and began to pick up the corn and among the rest the pair of pigeons presently the shepigeon fell into the net and struggled to get free whereupon all the other birds flew away and her mate whom she had saved fled with the rest and did not return to her meantime sleep had again overcome the fowler and when he awoke after long slumbering he saw the shepigeon caught in the net so he went up to her and freeing her feet from the meshes cut her throat the princess startled by the dream awoke troubled and said 'thus do men with women for women have pity on men and throw away their lives for them when they are in difficulties but if the lord decree against a woman and she fall into calamity her mate deserteth her and rescueth her not and wasted is that which she did with him of kindness allah curse her who putteth her trust in men for they ill requite the fair offices which women do them' and from that day she conceived an hatred to men said the king's son o my mother doth she never go out into the highways and the old woman replied nay o my son but i will tell thee somewhat wherein allah willing there shall be profit for thee she hath a garden which is of the goodliest pleasaunces of the age and every year at the time of the ripening of the fruits she goeth thither and taketh her pleasure therein only one day nor layeth the night but in her pavilion she entereth the garden by the private wicket of the palace which leadeth thereto and thou must know that it wanteth now but a month to the time of her going forth so take my advice and hie thee this very day to the keeper of that garden and make acquaintance with him and gain his good graces for he admitteth not one of allah's creatures into the garth because of its communication with the princess's palace i will let thee know two days beforehand of the day fixed for her coming forth when do thou repair to the garden as of thy wont and make shift to night there when the king's daughter cometh be thou hidden in some place or otherand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentyfifth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the old woman charged the king's son saying i will let thee know two days beforehand of the king's daughter going down to the garden do thou hide thee in some place or other and when thou espiest her come forth and show thyself to her when she seeth thee she will fall in love with thee for thou art fair to look upon and love covereth all things so keep thine eyes cool and clear and be of good cheer o my son for needs must i bring about union between thee and her the young prince kissed her hand and thanked her and gave her three pieces of alexandrian silk and three of satin of various colours and with each piece linen for shifts and stuff for trousers and a kerchief for the turband and fine white cotton cloth of ba'albak for the linings so as to make her six complete suits each handsomer than its sister moreover he gave her a purse containing six hundred gold pieces and said to her this is for the tailoring she took the whole and said to him o my son art thou not pleased to acquaint me with thine abidingplace and i also will show thee the way to my lodging yes answered he and sent a mameluke with her to note her home and show her his own house then he rose and bidding his slaves shut the shop went back to the wazir to whom he related all that had passed between him and the old woman from first to last quoth the minister o my son should the princess hayat alnufus come out and look upon thee and thou find no favour with her what wilt thou do quoth ardashir there will be nothing left but to pass from words to deeds and risk my life with her for i will snatch her up from amongst her attendants and set her behind me on a swift horse and make for the wildest of the wold if i escape i shall have won my wish and if i perish i shall be at rest from this hateful life rejoined the minister o my son dost thou think to do this thing and live how shall we make our escape seeing that our country is far distant and how wilt thou deal thus with a king of the kings of the age who hath under his hand an hundred thousand horse nor can we be sure but that he will despatch some of his troops to cut off our way verily there is no good in this project which no wise man would attempt asked ardashir and how then shall we do o wazir of good counsel for unless i win her i am a dead man without a chance the minister answered wait till tomorrow when we will visit this garden and note its condition and see what betideth us with the caretaker so when the morning morrowed they took a thousand dinars in a poke and repairing to the garden found it compassed about with high walls and strong rich in trees and rillfull leas and goodly fruiteries and indeed its flowers breathed perfume and its birds warbled amid the bloom as it were a garden of the gardens of paradise within the door sat a shaykh an old man on a stone bench and they saluted him when he saw them and noted the fairness of their favour he rose to his feet after returning their salute and said o my lords perchance ye have a wish which we may have the honour of satisfying replied the wazir know o elder that we are strangers and the heat hath overcome us our lodging is afar off at the other end of the city so we desire of thy courtesy that thou take these two dinars and buy us somewhat of provaunt and open us meanwhile the door of this flowergarden and seat us in some shaded place where there is cold water that we may cool ourselves there against thy return with the provision when we will eat and thou with us and then rested and refreshed we shall wend our ways so saying he pulled out of his pouch a couple of dinars and put them into the keeper's hand now this caretaker was a man aged threescore and ten who had never in all his life possessed so much money so when he saw the two dinars in his hand he was like to fly for joy and rising forthwith opened the garden gate to the prince and the wazir and made them enter and sit down under a widespreading fruitladen shadeaffording tree saying sit ye here and go no further into the garden for it hath a privy door communicating with the palace of the princess hayat alnufus they replied we will not stir hence whereupon he went out to buy what they had ordered and returned after awhile with a porter bearing on his head a roasted lamb and bread they ate and drank together and talked awhile till presently the wazir looking about him in all corners right and left caught sight of a lofty pavilion at the farther end of the garden but it was old and the plaster was peeled from its walls and its buttresses were broken down so he said to the gardener o shaykh is this garden thine own or dost thou hire it and he replied i am neither owner nor tenant of the garden only its caretaker asked the minister and what is thy wage whereto the old man answered a dinar a month and quoth the wazir verily they wrong thee especially an thou have a family quoth the elder by allah o my lord i have eight children and i the wazir broke in there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great thou makest me bear thy grief my poor fellow what wouldst thou say of him who should do thee a good turn on account of this family of thine replied the old man o my lord whatsoever good thou dost shall be garnered up for thee with god the most high thereupon said the wazir o shaykh thou knowest this garden of thine to be a goodly place but the pavilion yonder is old and ruinous now i mean to repair it and stucco it anew and paint it handsomely so that it will be the finest thing in the garth and when the owner comes and finds the pavilion restored and beautified he will not fail to question thee concerning it then do thou say 'o my lord at great expense i set it in repair for that i saw it in ruins and none could make use of it nor could anyone sit therein' if he says 'whence hadst thou the money for this' reply 'i spent of my own money upon the stucco thereby thinking to whiten my face with thee and hoping for thy bounties' and needs must he recompense thee fairly over the extent of thine expenses tomorrow i will bring builders and plasterers and painters to repair this pavilion and will give thee what i promised thee then he pulled out of his poke a purse of five hundred dinars and gave it to the gardener saying take these gold pieces and expend them upon thy family and let them pray for me and for this my son thereupon the prince asked the wazir what is the meaning of all this and he answered thou shalt presently see the issue thereofand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentysixth nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the wazir gave five hundred ducats to the old gardener saying take these gold pieces and expend them upon thy family and let them pray for this my son the old man looked at the gold and his wits fled so he fell down at the wazir's feet kissing them and invoking blessings on him and his son and when they went away he said to them i shall expect you tomorrow for by allah almighty there must be no parting between us night or day next morning the wazir went to the prince's shop and sent for the syndic of the builders then he carried him and his men to the garth where the gardener rejoiced in their sight he gave them the price of rations and what was needful to the work men for the restoration of the pavilion and they repaired it and stucco'd it and decorated it then said the minister to the painters harkye my masters listen to my words and apprehend my wish and my aim know that i have a garden like this where i was sleeping one night among the nights and saw in a dream a fowler set up nets and sprinkle corn thereabout the birds flocked to pick up the grain and a cockbird fell into the net whereupon the others took fright and flew away and amongst the rest his mate but after awhile she returned alone and picked at the mesh that held his feet till she set him free and they flew away together now the fowler had fallen asleep and when he awoke he found the net empty so he mended it and strewing fresh grain sat down afar off waiting for game to fall into that snare presently the birds assembled again to pick up the grains and amongst the rest the two pigeons byandby the henbird fell into the net when all the other birds took fright at her and flew away and her husband flew with them and did not return whereupon the fowler came up and taking the quarry cut her throat now when her mate flew away with the others a bird of raven seized him and slew him and ate his flesh and drank his blood and i would have you pourtray me the presentment of this my dream even as i have related it to you in the liveliest colours laying the fair scene in this rare garden with its walls and trees and rills and dwell especially on the fowler and the falcon if ye do this i have set forth to you and the work please me i will give you what shall gladden your hearts over and above your wage the painters hearing these words applied themselves with all diligence to do what he required of them and wrought it out in masterly style and when they had made an end of the work they showed it to the wazir who seeing his socalled dream set forth as it was was pleased and thanked them and rewarded them munificently presently the prince came in according to his custom and entered the pavilion unweeting what the wazir had done so when he saw the portraiture of the fowler and the birds and the net and beheld the male pigeon in the clutches of the hawk which had slain him and was drinking his blood and eating his flesh his understanding was confounded and he returned to the minister and said o wazir of good counsel i have seen this day a marvel which were it graven with needlegravers on the eyecorners would be a warner to whoso will be warned asked the minister and what is that o my lord and the prince answered did i not tell thee of the dream the princess had and how it was the cause of her hatred for men yes replied the wazir and ardashir rejoined by allah o minister i have seen the whole dream pourtrayed in painting as i had eyed it with mine own eyes but i found therein a circumstance which was hidden from the princess so that she saw it not and 'tis upon this that i rely for the winning of my wish quoth the wazir and what is that o my son and quoth the prince i saw that when the male bird flew away and leaving his mate entangled in the net failed to return and save her a falcon pounced on him and slaying him ate his flesh and drank his blood would to heaven the princess had seen the whole of the dream and had beheld the cause of his failure to return and rescue her replied the wazir by allah o auspicious king this is indeed a rare thing and a wonderful and the king's son ceased not to marvel at the picture and lament that the king's daughter had not beheld the dream to its end saying in himself would she had seen it to the last or might see the whole over again though but in the imbroglio of sleep then quoth the wazir to him thou saidst to me 'why wilt thou repair the pavilion' and i replied 'thou shalt presently see the issue thereof' and behold now its issue thou seest for it was i did this deed and bade the painters pourtray the princess's dream thus and paint the male bird in the pounces of the falcon which eateth his flesh and drinketh his blood so that when she cometh to the pavilion she will behold her dream depicted and see how the cockpigeon was slain and excuse him and turn from her hate for men when the prince heard the wazir's words he kissed his hands and thanked him saying verily the like of thee is fit to be minister to the most mighty king and by allah an i win my wish and return to my sire rejoicing i will assuredly acquaint him with this that he may redouble in honouring thee and advance thee in dignity and hearken to thine every word so the wazir kissed his hand and they both went to the old gardener and said look at yonder pavilion and see how fine it is and he replied this is all of your happy thought then said they o elder when the owners of the place question thee concerning the restoration of the pavilion say thou ''twas i did it of my own monies' to the intent that there may betide thee fair favour and good fortune he said i hear and i obey and the prince continued to pay him frequent visits such was the case with the prince and the wazir but as regards hayat alnufus when she ceased to receive the prince's letters and messages and when the old woman was absent from her she rejoiced with joy exceeding and concluded that the young man had returned to his own country one day there came to her a covered tray from her father so she uncovered it and finding therein fine fruits asked her waitingwomen is the season of these fruits come answered they yes thereupon she cried would we might make ready to take our pleasure in the flowergardenand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the princess after receiving the fruit from her sire asked is the season of these fruits set in and they answered yes thereupon she cried would we might make ready to take our pleasure in the flowergarden o my lady they replied thou sayest well and by allah we also long for the garden so she enquired how shall we do seeing that every year it is none save my nurse who taketh us to walk in the garden and who pointeth out to us the various trees and plants and i have beaten her and forbidden her from me indeed i repent me of what was done by me to her for that in any case she is my nurse and hath over me the right of fosterage but there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great when her handmaids heard this they all sprang up and kissing the ground between her hands exclaimed allah upon thee o my lady do thou pardon her and bid her to the presence and quoth she by allah i am resolved upon this but which of you will go to her for i have prepared her a splendid robe of honour hereupon two damsels came forward by name bulbul and siwad al'ayn who were comely and graceful and the principals among the princess's women and her favourites and they said we will go to her o king's daughter and she said do what seemeth good to you so they went to the house of the nurse and knocked at the door and entered and she recognising the twain received them with open arms and welcomed them when they had sat awhile with her they said to her o nurse the princess pardoneth thee and desireth to take thee back into favour she replied this may never be though i drink the cup of ruin hast thou forgotten how she put me to shame before those who love me and those who hate me when my clothes were dyed with my blood and i well nigh died for stress of beating and after this they dragged me forth by the feet like a dead dog and cast me without the door so by allah i will never return to her nor fill my eyes with her sight quoth the two girls disappoint not our pains in coming to thee nor send us away unsuccessful where is thy courtesy uswards think but who it is that cometh in to visit thee canst thou wish for any higher of standing than we with the king's daughter she replied i take refuge with allah well i wot that my station is less than yours were it not that the princess's favour exalted me above all her women so that were i wroth with the greatest of them she had died in her skin of fright they rejoined all is as it was and naught is in anywise changed indeed 'tis better than before for the princess humbleth herself to thee and seeketh a reconciliation without intermediary said the old woman by allah were it not for your presence and intercession with me i had never returned to her no not though she had commanded to slay me they thanked her for this and she rose and dressing herself accompanied them to the palace now when the king's daughter saw her she sprang to her feet in honour and the old woman said allah allah o king's daughter say me whose was the fault mine or thine hayat alnufus replied the fault was mine and 'tis thine to pardon and forgive by allah o my nurse thy rank is high with me and thou hast over me the right of fosterage but thou knowest that allah extolled and exalted be he hath allotted to his creatures four things disposition life daily bread and death nor is it in man's power to avert that which is decreed verily i was beside myself and could not recover my senses but o my nurse i repent of what deed i did with this the crone's anger ceased from her and she rose and kissed the ground before the princess who called for a costly robe of honour and threw it over her whereat she rejoiced with exceeding joy in the presence of the princess's slaves and women when all ended thus happily hayat alnufus said to the old woman o my nurse how go the fruits and growths of our garth and she replied o my lady i see excellent fruits in the town but i will enquire of this matter and return thee an answer this very day then she withdrew honoured with all honour and betook herself to ardashir who received her with open arms and embraced her and rejoiced in her coming for that he had expected her long and longingly she told him all that had passed between herself and the princess and how her mistress was minded to go down into the garden on such a dayand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentyeighth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the old woman betook herself to the prince and told him all that had passed between herself and the princess hayat alnufus and how her mistress was minded to go down into the garden on such a day and said to him hast thou done as i bade thee with the warder of the garden and hast thou made him taste of thy bounties he replied yes and the oldster is become my good friend my way is his way and he would well i had need of him then he told her all that had happened and of the dreampaintings which the wazir had caused to be limned in the pavilion especially of the fowler the net and the falcon whereat she joyed with great joy and said allah upon thee do thou set thy minister mid most thy heart for this that he hath done pointeth to the keenness of his wit and he hath helped thee to the winning thy wish so rise forthright o my son and go to the hammambath and don thy daintiest dress wherein may be our success then fare thou to the gardener and make shift to pass the night in the garden for though he should give the earth full of gold none may win to pass into it whilst the king's daughter is therein when thou hast entered hide thee where no eye may espy thee and keep concealed till thou hear me cry 'o thou whose boons are hidden save us from that we fear' then come forth from thine ambush and walk among the trees and show thy beauty and loveliness which put the moons to shame to the intent that princess hayat alnufus may see thee and that her heart and soul may be filled with love of thee so shalt thou attain to thy wish and thy grief be gone to hear is to obey replied the young prince and gave her a purse of a thousand dinars which she took and went away thereupon ardashir fared straight for the bath and washed after which he arrayed himself in the richest of robes of the apparel of the kings of the chosroes and girt his middle with a girdle wherein were conjoined all manner precious stones and donned a turband inwoven with red gold and purfled with pearls and gems his cheeks shone rosyred and his lips were scarlet his eyelids like the gazelle's wantoned like a winestruck wight in his gait he swayed beauty and loveliness garbed him and his shape shamed the bowing of the bough then he put in his pocket a purse containing a thousand dinars and repairing to the flowergarden knocked at the door the gardener opened to him and rejoicing with great joy salamed to him in most worshipful fashion then observing that his face was overcast he asked him how he did the king's son answered know o elder that i am dear to my father and he never laid his hand on me till this day when words arose between us and he abused me and smote me on the face and struck me with his staff and drave me away now i have no friend to turn to and i fear the perfidy of fortune for thou knowest that the wrath of parents is no light thing wherefore i come to thee o uncle seeing that to my father thou art known and i desire of thy favour that thou suffer me abide in the garden till the end of the day or pass the night there till allah grant good understanding between myself and my sire when the old man heard these words he was concerned anent what had occurred and said o my lord dost thou give me leave to go to thy sire and be the means of reconciliation between thee and him replied ardashir o uncle thou must know that my father is of impatient nature and irascible so an thou proffer him reconciliation in his heat of temper he will make thee no answer but when a day or two shall have passed his heat will soften then go thou in to him and thereupon he will relent hearkening and obedience quoth the gardener but o my lord do thou come with me to my house where thou shalt night with my children and my family and none shall reproach this to us quoth ardashir o uncle i must be alone when i am angry the old man said it irketh me that thou shouldst lie solitary in the garden when i have a house but ardashir said o uncle i have an aim in this that the trouble of my mind may be dispelled from me and i know that in this lies the means of regaining his favour and softening his heart to me rejoined the gardener i will fetch thee a carpet to sleep on and a coverlet wherewith to cover thee and the prince said there is no harm in that o uncle so the keeper rose and opened the garden to him and brought him the carpet and coverlet knowing not that the king's daughter was minded to visit the garth on this wise fared it with the prince but as regards the nurse she returned to the princess and told her that the fruits were kindly ripe on the garden trees whereupon she said o my nurse go down with me tomorrow into the garden that we may walk about in it and take our pleasureinshallah and send meanwhile to the gardener to let him know what we purpose so she sent to the gardener to say the princess will visit the parterre tomorrow so leave neither watercarriers nor treetenders therein nor let one of allah's creatures enter the garth when word came to him he set his waterways and channels in order and going to ardashir said to him o my lord the king's daughter is mistress of this garden and i have only to crave thy pardon for the place is thy place and i live only in thy favours except that my tongue is under thy feet i must tell thee that the princess hayat alnufus hath a mind to visit it tomorrow at the first of the day and hath bidden me leave none therein who might look upon her so i would have thee of thy favour go forth of the garden this day for the queen will abide only in it till the time of midafternoon prayer and after it shall be at thy service for se'nnights and fortnights months and years ardashir asked o elder haply we have caused thee some mishap and the other answered by allah o my lord naught hath betided me from thee but honour rejoined the prince an it be so nothing but all good shall befal thee through us for i will hide in the garden and none shall espy me till the king's daughter hath gone back to her palace said the gardener o my lord an she espy the shadow of a man in the garden or any of allah's male creatures she will strike off my headand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and twentyninth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the gardener said to the prince an the king's daughter espy the shadow of a man in her garden she will strike off my head the youth replied have no fear i will on no wise let any see me but doubtless today thou lackest of spendingmoney for thy family then he put his hand to his purse and pulled out five hundred ducats which he gave to him saying take this gold and lay it out on thy family that thy heart may be at ease concerning them when the shaykh looked upon the gold his life seemed a light thing to him and he suffered the prince to tarry where he was charging him straitly not to show himself in the garden then he left him loitering about meanwhile when the eunuchs went in to the princess at break of day she bade open the private wicket leading from the palace to the parterres and donned a royal robe embroidered with pearls and jewels and gems over a shift of fine silk purfled with rubies under the whole was that which tongue refuseth to explain whereat was confounded the brain and whose love would embrave the craven's strain on her head she set a crown of red gold inlaid with pearls and gems and she tripped in pattens of cloth of gold embroidered with fresh pearls and adorned with all manner precious stones then she put her hand upon the old woman's shoulder and commanded to go forth by the privy door but the nurse looked at the garden and seeing it full of eunuchs and handmaids walking about eating the fruits and troubling the streams and taking their ease of sport and pleasure in the water said to the princess o my lady is this a garden or a madhouse quoth the princess what meaneth thy speech o nurse and quoth the old woman verily the garden is full of slavegirls and eunuchs eating of the fruits and troubling the streams and scaring the birds and hindering us from taking our ease and sporting and laughing and what not else and thou hast no need of them wert thou going forth of thy palace into the highway this would be fitting as an honour and a ward to thee but now o my lady thou goest forth of the wicket into the garden where none of almighty allah's creatures may look on thee rejoined the princess by allah o nurse mine thou sayst sooth but how shall we do and the old woman said bid the eunuchs send them all away and keep only two of the slavegirls that we may make merry with them so she dismissed them all with the exception of two of her handmaids who were most in favour with her but when the old woman saw that her heart was light and that the season was pleasant to her she said to her now we can enjoy ourselves aright so up and let us take our pleasance in the garden the princess put her hand upon her shoulder and went out by the private door the two waitingwomen walked in front and she followed them laughing at them and swaying gracefully to and fro in her ample robes whilst the nurse forewent her showing her the trees and feeding her with fruits and so they fared on from place to place till they came to the pavilion which when the king's daughter beheld and saw that it had been restored she asked the old woman o my nurse seest thou yonder pavilion it hath been repaired and its walls whitened she answered by allah o my lady i heard say that the keeper of the garden had taken stuffs of a company of merchants and sold them and bought bricks and lime and plaster and stones and so forth with the price so i asked him what he had done with all this and he said 'i have repaired the pavilion which lay in ruins' presently adding 'and when the merchants sought their due of me i said to them 'wait 'till the princess visit the garden and see the repairs and they satisfy her then will i take of her what she is pleased to bestow on me and pay you what is your due' quoth i 'what moved thee to do this thing' and quoth he 'i saw the pavilion in ruins the coigns thrown down and the stucco peeled from the walls and none had the grace to repair it so i borrowed the coin on my own account and restored the place and i trust in the king's daughter to deal with me as befitteth her dignity' i said 'the princess is all goodness and generosity and will no doubt requite thee' and he did all this but in hopes of thy bounty replied the princess by allah he hath dealt nobly in rebuilding it and hath done the deed of generous men call me my pursekeeperess the old woman accordingly fetched the pursekeeperess whom the princess bade give the gardener two thousand dinars whereupon the nurse sent to him bidding him to the presence of the king's daughter but when the messenger said to him obey the queen's order the gardener felt feeble and trembling in every joint said in himself doubtless the princess hath seen the young man and this day will be the most unlucky of days for me so he went home and told his wife and children what had happened and gave them his last charges and farewelled them while they wept for and with him then he presented himself before the princess with a face the colour of turmeric and ready to fall flat at full length the old woman remarked his plight and hastened to forestall him saying o shaykh kiss the earth in thanksgiving to almighty allah and be constant in prayer to him for the princess i told her what thou didst in the matter of repairing the ruined pavilion and she rejoiceth in this and bestoweth on thee two thousand dinars in requital of thy pains so take them from the pursekeeperess and kiss the earth before the king's daughter and bless her and wend thy way hearing these words he took the gold and kissed the ground before hayat alnufus calling down blessings on her then he returned to his house and his family rejoiced in him and blessed him who had been the prime cause of this businessand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and thirtieth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the caretaker took the two thousand ducats from the princess and returned to his house all his family rejoiced in him and blessed him who had been the prime cause of this business thus it fared with these but as regards the old woman she said to the princess o my lady this is indeed become a fine place never saw i a purer white than its plastering nor properer than its painting i wonder if he have also repaired it within else hath he made the outside white and left the inside black come let us enter and inspect so they went in the nurse preceding and found the interior painted and gilded in the goodliest way the princess looked right and left till she came to the upper end of the estrade when she fixed her eyes upon the wall and gazed long and earnestly thereat whereupon the old woman knew that her glance had lighted on the presentment of her dream and took the two waitingwomen away with her that they might not divert her mind when the king's daughter had made an end of examining the painting she turned to the old woman wondering and beating hand on hand and said to her o my nurse come see a wondrous thing which were it graven with needlegravers on the eye corners would be a warner to whoso will be warned she replied and what is that o my lady when the princess rejoined go look at the upper end of the estrade and tell me what thou seest there so she went up and considered the dreamdrawing then she came down wondering and said by allah o my lady here is depicted the garden and the fowler and his net and the birds and all thou sawest in thy dream and verily nothing but urgent need withheld the male pigeon from returning to free his mate after he had fled her for i see him in the talons of a bird of raven which hath slaughtered him and is drinking his blood and rending his flesh and eating it and this o my lady caused his tarrying to return and rescue her from the net but o my mistress the wonder is how thy dream came to be thus depicted for wert thou minded to set it forth in painture thou hadst not availed to portray it by allah this is a marvel which should be recorded in histories surely o my lady the angels appointed to attend upon the sons of adam knew that the cockpigeon was wronged of us because we blamed him for deserting his mate so they embraced his cause and made manifest his excuse and now for the first time we see him in the hawk's pounces a dead bird quoth the princess o my nurse verily fate and fortune had course against this bird and we did him wrong quoth the nurse o my mistress foes shall meet before allah the most high but o my lady verily the truth hath been made manifest and the male pigeon's excuse certified to us for had the hawk not seized him and drunk his blood and rent his flesh he had not held aloof from his mate but had returned to her and set her free from the net but against death there is no recourse nor o my lady is there aught in the world more tenderly solicitous than the male for the female among all creatures which almighty allah hath created and especially 'tis thus with man for he starveth himself to feed his wife strippeth himself to clothe her angereth his family to please her and disobeyeth and denieth his parents to endow her she knoweth his secrets and concealeth them and she cannot endure from him a single hour an he be absent from her one night her eyes sleep not nor is there a dearer to her than he she loveth him more than her parents and they lie down to sleep in each other's arms with his hand under her neck and her hand under his neck even as saith the poet'i made my wrist her pillow and i lay with her in litter nbsp and i said to night 'be long' while the full moon showednbsp glitterah me it was a night allah never made its like  whosenbsp first was sweetest sweet and whose last bitt'restnbsp bitter'then he kisseth her and she kisseth him and i have heard of a certain king that when his wife fell sick and died he buried himself alive with her submitting himself to death for the love of her and the strait companionship which was between them moreover a certain king sickened and died and when they were about to bury him his wife said to her people 'let me bury myself alive with him else will i slay myself and my blood shall be on your heads' so when they saw she would not be turned from this thing they left her and she cast herself into the grave with her dead husband of the greatness of her love and tenderness for him and the old woman ceased not to ply the princess with anecdotes of conjugal love between men and women till there ceased that which was in her heart of hatred for the sex masculine and when she felt that she had succeeded in renewing in her the natural inclination of woman to man she said to her 'tis time to go and walk in the garden so they fared forth from the pavilion and paced among the trees presently the prince chanced to turn and his eyes fell on hayat alnufus and when he saw the symmetry of her shape and the rosiclearness of her cheeks and the blackness of her eyes and her exceeding grace and her passing loveliness and her excelling beauty and her prevailing elegance and her abounding perfection his reason was confounded and he could not take his eyes off her passion annihilated his right judgment and love overpassed all limits in him his vitals were occupied with her service and his heart was aflame with the fire of repine so that he swooned away and fell to the ground when he came to himself she had passed from his sight and was hidden from him among the treesand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and thirtyfirst nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when prince ardashir who lay hid in the garden saw the princess and her nurse walking amongst the trees he swooned away for very lovelonging when he came to himself hayat alnufus had passed from his sight and was hidden from him among the trees so he sighed from his heartcore and improvised these coupletswhenas mine eyes behold her loveliness  my heart is tornnbsp with love's own ecstasyi wake o'erthrown castdown on face of earth  nor can thenbsp princess my sore torment seeshe turned and ravished this sad lovethrall'd sprite nbsp mercy by allah ruth nay sympathyo lord afford me union deign thou soothe  my soul erenbsp graveniche house this corse of mei'll kiss her ten times ten times and times ten  for lover'snbsp wasted cheek the kisses bethe old woman ceased not to lead the princess apleasuring about the garden till they reached the place where the prince lay ambushed when behold she said o thou whose bounties are hidden vouchsafe us assurance from that we fear the king's son hearing the signal left his lurkingplace and surprised by the summons walked among the trees swaying to and fro with a proud and graceful gait and a shape that shamed the branches his brow was crowned with pearly drops and his cheeks red as the afterglow extolled be allah the almighty in that he hath created when the king's daughter caught sight of him she gazed a long while on him and noticed his beauty and grace and loveliness and his eyes that wantoned like the gazelle's and his shape that outvied the branches of the myrobalan wherefore her wits were confounded and her soul captivated and her heart transfixed with the arrows of his glances then she said to the old woman o my nurse whence came yonder handsome youth and the nurse asked where is he o my lady there he is answered hayat alnufus near hand among the trees the old woman turned right and left as if she knew not of his presence and cried and pray who can have taught this youth the way into this garden quoth hayat alnufus who shall give us news of the young man glory be to him who created men but say me dost thou know him o my nurse quoth the old woman o my lady he is the young merchant who wrote to thee by me the princess and indeed she was drowned in the sea of her desire and the fire of her passion and lovelonging broke out o my nurse how goodly is this youth indeed he is fair of favour methinks there is not on the face of earth a goodlier than he now when the old woman was assured that the love of him had gotten possession of the princess she said to her did i not tell thee o my lady that he was a comely youth with a beaming favour replied hayat alnufus o my nurse king's daughters know not the ways of the world nor the manners of those that be therein for that they company with none neither give they nor take they o my nurse how shall i do to bring about a meeting and present myself to him and what shall i say to him and what will he say to me said the old woman what device is left me indeed we were confounded in this matter by thy behaviour and the princess said o my nurse know thou that if any ever died of passion i shall do so and behold i look for nothing but death on the spot by reason of the fire of my lovelonging when the old woman heard her words and saw the transport of her desire for him she answered o my lady now as for his coming to thee there is no way thereto and indeed thou art excused from going to him because of thy tender age but rise with me and follow me i will accost him so shalt thou not be put to shame and in the twinkling of an eye affection shall ensue between you the king's daughter cried go thou before me for the decree of allah may not be rejected accordingly they went up to the place where ardashir sat as he were the full moon at its fullest and the old woman said to him see o youth who is present before thee 'tis the daughter of our king of the age hayat alnufus bethink thee of her rank and appreciate the honour she doth thee in coming to thee and rise out of respect for her and stand before her the prince sprang to his feet in an instant and his eyes met her eyes whereupon they both became as they were drunken without wine then the love of him and desire redoubled upon the princess and she opened her arms and he his and they embraced but lovelonging and passion overcame them and they swooned away and fell to the ground and lay a long while without sense the old woman fearing scandalous exposure carried them both into the pavilion and sitting down at the door said to the two waitingwomen seize the occasion to take your pleasure in the garden for the princess sleepeth so they returned to their diversion presently the lovers revived from their swoon and found themselves in the pavilion whereat quoth the prince allah upon thee o princess of fair ones is this vision or sleepillusion then the twain embraced and intoxicated themselves without wine complaining each to other of the anguish of passion and the prince improvised these coupletssun riseth sheen from her brilliant brow  and her cheeknbsp shows the rosiest afterglowand when both appear to the lookeron  the skyline starnbsp ne'er for shame will showan the leven flash from those smiling lips  morn breaks andnbsp the rays dusk and gloom

dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and thirtysecond nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the prince had made an end of his verses the princess strained him to her bosom and kissed him on the mouth and between the eyes whereupon his soul returned to him and he fell to complaining to her of that he had endured for stress of love and tyranny of longing and excess of transport and distraction and all he had suffered for the hardness of her heart hearing those words she kissed his hands and feet and bared her head whereupon the gloom gathered and the full moons dawned therein then said she to him o my beloved and term of all my wishes would the day of estrangement had never been and allah grant it may never return between us and they embraced and wept together whilst she recited these coupletso who shamest the moon and the sunny glow  thou whosenbsp slaught'ring tyranny lays me lowwith the sword of a look thou hast shorn

became troubled and distracted for love of her so he drew nearer to her and kissed her hands and wept with sore weeping and they ceased not from loverreproaches and converse and versifying until the call to midafternoon prayer nor was there aught between them other than this when they bethought them of parting and she said to him o light of mine eyes and core of my heart the time of severance has come between us twain when shall we meet again by allah replied he and indeed her words shot him as with shafts to mention of parting i am never fain then she went forth of the pavilion and he turned and saw her sighing sighs would melt the rock and weeping showerlike tears whereupon he for love was sunken in the sea of desolation and improvised these coupletso my heart's desire grows my misery  from the stress ofnbsp love and what cure for meby thy face like dawn when it lights the dark  and thy hairnbsp whose hue beareth nighttide's bleeand thy form like the branch which in grace inclines

to seenow when she heard his verses in praise of her she turned back to him and embracing him with a heart on fire for the anguish of severance fire which naught save kisses and embraces might quench cried sooth the byword saith patience is for a lover and not the lack thereof there is no help for it but i contrive a means for our reunion then she farewelled him and fared forth knowing not where she set her feet for stress of her love nor did she stay her steps till she found herself in her own chamber when she was gone passion and lovelonging redoubled upon the young prince and the delight of sleep was forbidden him and the princess in her turn tasted not food and her patience failed and she sickened for desire as soon as dawned the day she sent for the nurse who came and found her condition changed and she cried question me not of my case for all i suffer is due to thy handiwork where is the beloved of my heart o my lady when did he leave thee hath he been absent from thee more than this night can i endure absence from him an hour come find some means to bring us together speedily for my soul is like to flee my body o my lady have patience till i contrive thee some subtle device whereof none shall be ware by the great god except thou bring him to me this very day i will tell the king that thou hast corrupted me and he will cut off thy head i conjure thee by allah have patience with me for this is a dangerous matter and the nurse humbled herself to her till she granted her three days' delay saying o my nurse the three days will be three years to me and if the fourth day pass and thou bring him not i will go about to slay thee so the old woman left her and returned to her lodging where she abode till the morning of the fourth day when she summoned the tirewomen of the town and sought of them fine dyes and rouge for the painting of a virgin girl and adorning and they brought her cosmetics of the best then she sent for the prince and opening her chest brought out a bundle containing a suit of woman's apparel worth five thousand dinars and a headkerchief fringed with all manner gems then said she to him o my son hast thou a mind to foregather with hayat alnufus and he replied yes so she took a pair of tweezers and pulled out the hairs of his face and pencilled his eyes with kohl then she stripped him and painted him with henna from his nails to his shoulders and from his insteps to his thighs and tattooed him about the body till he was like red roses upon alabaster slabs after a little she washed him and dried him and bringing out a shift and a pair of petticoattrousers made him put them on then she clad him in the royal suit aforesaid and binding the kerchief about his head veiled him and taught him how to walk saying advance thy left and draw back thy right he did her bidding and forewent her as he were a houri faring abroad from paradise then said she to him fortify thy heart for thou art going to the king's palace where there will without fail be guards and eunuchs at the gate and if thou be startled at them and show doubt or dread they will suspect thee and examine thee and we shall both get into grievous trouble and haply lose our lives wherefore an thou feel thyself unable to this tell me he answered in very sooth this thing hath no terrors for me so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear then she went out preceding him till the twain came to the palacegate which was full of eunuchs she turned and looked at him as much as to say art thou troubled or no and finding him all unchanged went on the chief eunuch glanced at the nurse and knew her but seeing a damsel following her whose charms confounded the reason he said in his mind as for the old woman she is the nurse but as for the girl who is with her there is none in our land resembleth her in favour or approacheth her in fairness save the princess hayat alnufus who is secluded and never goeth out would i knew how she came into the streets and would heaven i wot whether or no 'twas by leave of the king then he rose to learn somewhat concerning her and well nigh thirty castratos followed him which when the old woman saw her reason fled for fear and she said verily we are allah's and to him we shall return without recourse we are dead folk this timeand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and thirtythird nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the old nurse saw the head of the eunuchry and his assistants making for her she was in exceeding fear and cried there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great verily we are god's and unto him we shall return without recourse we be dead folk this time when the head eunuch heard her speak thus fear gat hold upon him by reason of that which he knew of the princess's violence and that her father was ruled by her and he said to himself belike the king hath commanded the nurse to carry his daughter forth upon some occasion of hers whereof she would have none know and if i oppose her she will be wroth with me and will say 'this eunuch fellow stopped me that he might pry into my affairs' so she will do her best to kill me and i have no call to meddle in this matter so saying he turned back and with him the thirty assistants who drove the people from the door of the palace whereupon the nurse entered and saluted the eunuchs with her head whilst all the thirty stood to do her honour and returned her salam she led in the prince and he ceased not following her from door to door and the protector protected them so that they passed all the guards till they came to the seventh door it was that of the great pavilion wherein was the king's throne and it communicated with the chambers of his women and the saloons of the harim as well as with his daughter's pavilion so the old woman halted and said here we are o my son and glory be to him who hath brought us thus far in safety but o my son we cannot foregather with the princess except by night for night enveileth the fearful he replied true but what is to be done quoth she hide thee in this black hole showing him behind the door a dark and deep cistern with a cover thereto so he entered the cistern and she went away and left him there till ended day when she returned and carried him into the palace till they came to the door of hayat alnufus's apartment the old woman knocked and a little maid came out and said who is at the door said the nurse 'tis i whereupon the maid returned and craved permission of her lady who said open to her and let her come in with any who may accompany her so they entered and the nurse casting a glance around perceived that the princess had made ready the sittingchamber and ranged the lamps in row and lighted candles of wax in chandeliers of gold and silver and spread the divans and estrades with carpets and cushions moreover she had set on trays of food and fruits and confections and she had perfumed the place with musk and aloeswood and ambergris she was seated among the lamps and the tapers and the light of her face outshone the lustre of them all when she saw the old woman she said to her o nurse where is the beloved of my heart and the other replied o my lady i cannot find him nor have mine eyes espied him but i have brought thee his own sister and here she is cried the princess art thou jinnmad what need have i of his sister say me an a man's head irk him doth he bind up his hand the old woman answered no by allah o my lady but look on her and if she pleases thee let her be with thee then she uncovered the prince's face whereupon hayat alnufus knew him and running to him pressed him to her bosom and he pressed her to his breast then they both fell down in a swoon and lay without sense a long while the old woman sprinkled rosewater upon them till they came to themselves when she kissed him on the mouth more than a thousand times and improvised these coupletssought me this heart's dear love at gloom of night  i rosenbsp in honour till he sat forthrightand said 'o aim of mine o sole desire  in such nightvisitnbsp

the seven hundred and thirtyfourth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when her lover visited hayat alnufus in her palace the twain embraced and she improvised some happy couplets beseeming the occasion and when she had ended her extempore lines she said is it indeed true that i see thee in my abode and that thou art my cupmate and my familiar then passion grew on her and love was grievous to her so that her reason wellnigh fled for joy and she improvised these coupletswith all my soul i'll ransom him who came to me in gloom  ofnbsp night whilst i had waited long

bestnbsp become'then slept we even as we would the goodliest of nights  tillnbsp morning came to end our night and light up earth withnbsp bloomas soon as it was day she made him enter a place in her apartment unknown to any and he abode there till nightfall when she brought him out and they sat in converse and carouse presently he said to her i wish to return to my own country and tell my father what hath passed between us that he may equip his wazir to demand thee in marriage of thy sire she replied o my love i fear an thou return to thy country and kingdom thou wilt be distracted from me and forget the love of me or that thy father will not further thy wishes in this matter and i shall die meseems the better rede were that thou abide with me and in my handgrasp i looking on thy face and thou on mine till i devise some plan whereby we may escape together some night and flee to thy country for i have cut off my hopes from my own people and i despair of them he rejoined i hear and obey and they fell again to their carousal and conversing he tarried with her thus for some time till one night the wine was pleasant to them and they lay not down nor did they sleep till break of day now it chanced that one of the kings sent her father a present and amongst other things a necklace of union jewels nineandtwenty grains to whose price a king's treasures might not suffice quoth abd alkadir this riviere beseemeth none but my daughter hayat alnufus and turning to an eunuch whose jawteeth the princess had knocked out for reasons best known to herself he called to him and said carry the necklace to thy lady and say to her 'one of the kings hath sent thy father this as a present and its price may not be paid with money put it on thy neck' the slave took the necklace saying in himself allah almighty make it the last thing she shall put on in this world for that she deprived me of the benefit of my grinderteeth and repairing to the princess's apartment found the door locked and the old woman asleep before the threshold he shook her and she awoke in affright and asked what dost thou want to which he answered the king hath sent me on an errand to his daughter quoth the nurse the key is not here go away whilst i fetch it but quoth he i cannot go back to the king without having done his commandment so she went away as if to fetch the key but fear overtook her and she sought safety in flight then the eunuch awaited her awhile then finding she did not return he feared that the king would be angry at his delay so he rattled at the door and shook it whereupon the bolt gave way and the leaf opened he entered and passed on till he came to the seventh door and walking in to the princess's chamber found the place splendidly furnished and saw candles and flagons there at this spectacle he marvelled and going close up to the bed which was curtained by a hanging of silk embroidered with a network of jewels drew back the curtain from before the princess and saw her sleeping with her arms about the neck of a young man handsomer than herself whereat he magnified allah almighty who had created such a youth of vile water and said how goodly be this fashion for one who hateth men how came she by this fellow methinks 'twas on his account that she knocked out my back teeth then he drew the curtain and made for the door but the king's daughter awoke in affright and seeing the eunuch whose name was kafur called to him he made her no answer so she came down from the bed on the estrade and catching hold of his skirt laid it on her head and kissed his feet saying veil what allah veileth quoth he may allah not veil thee nor him who would veil thee thou didst knock out my grinders and saidst to me 'let none make mention to me aught of men and their ways' so saying he disengaged himself from her grasp and running out locked the door on them and set another eunuch to guard it then he went in to the king who said to him hast thou given the necklace to hayat alnufus the eunuch replied by allah thou deservest altogether a better fate and the king asked what hath happened tell me quickly whereto he answered i will not tell thee save in private and between our eyes but the king retorted saying tell me at once and in public cried the eunuch then grant me immunity so the king threw him the kerchief of immunity and he said o king i went into the princess hayat alnufus and found her asleep in a carpeted chamber and on her bosom was a young man so i locked the door upon the two and came back to thee when the king heard these words he started up and taking a sword in his hand cried out to the rais of the eunuchs saying take thy lads and go to the princess's chamber and bring me her and him who is with her as they twain lie on the bed but cover them both upand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and thirtyfifth nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the king commanded the head eunuch to take his lads and to fetch and set before him hayat alnufus and him who was with her the chief and his men entered the princess's apartment where he found her standing up dissolved in railing tears and the prince by her side so he said to them lie down on the bed as thou wast and let him do likewise the king's daughter feared for her lover and said to him this is no time for resistance so they both lay down and the eunuchs covered them up and carried the twain into the king's presence thereupon abd alkadir pulled off the coverings and the princess sprang to her feet he looked at her and would have smitten her neck but the prince threw himself on the father's breast saying the fault was not hers but mine only kill me before thou killest her the king made at him to cut him down but hayat alnufus cast herself on her father and said kill me not him for he is the son of a great king lord of all the land in its length and breadth when the king heard this he turned to the chief wazir who was a gatheringplace of all that is evil and said to him what sayst thou of this matter o minister quoth his wazir what i say is that all who find themselves in such case as this have need of lying and there is nothing for it but to cut off both their heads after torturing them with all manner of tortures hereupon the king called his sworder of vengeance who came with his lads and said to him take this gallows bird and strike off his head and after do the like with this harlot and burn their bodies and consult me not about them a second time so the headsmen put his hand to her back to take her but the king cried out at him and cast at him somewhat he hent in hand which had wellnigh killed him saying o dog how durst thou show ruth to those with whom i am wroth put thy hand to her hair and drag her along by it so that she may fall on her face accordingly he haled her by her hair and the prince in like manner to the place of blood where he tore off a piece of his skirt and therewith bound the prince's eyes putting the princess last in the hope that some one would intercede for her then having made ready the prince he swung his sharp sword three times whilst all the troops wept and prayed allah to send them deliverance by some intercessor and raised his hand to cut off ardashir's head when behold there arose a cloud of dust that spread and flew till it veiled the view now the cause thereof was that when the young prince had delayed beyond measure the king his sire had levied a mighty host and had marched with it in person to get tidings of his son such was his case but as regards king abd alkadir when he saw this he said o wights what is the meaning of yonder dust that dimmeth sights the grand wazir sprang up and went out to reconnoitre and found behind the cloud men like locusts of whom no count could be made nor aught avail of aid filling the hills and plains and valleys so he returned with the report to the king who said to him go down and learn for us what may be this host and the cause of its marching upon our country ask also of their commander and salute him for me and enquire the reason of his coming an he came in quest of aught we will aid him and if he have a bloodfeud with one of the kings we will ride with him or if he desire a gift we will handsel him for this is indeed a numerous host and a power uttermost and we fear for our land from its mischief so the minister went forth and walked among the tents and troopers and bodyguards and ceased not faring on from the first of the day till near sundown when he came to the warders with gilded swords in tents starstudded passing these he made his way through emirs and wazirs and nabobs and chamberlains to the pavilion of the sultan and found him a mighty king when the king's officers saw him they cried out to him saying kiss ground kiss ground he did so and would have risen but they cried out at him a second and a third time so he kissed the earth again and again and raised his head and would have stood up but fell down at full length for excess of awe when at last he was set between the hands of the king he said to him allah prolong thy days and increase thy sovranty and exalt thy rank o thou auspicious king and furthermore of a truth king abd alkadir saluteth thee and kisseth the earth before thee and asketh on what weighty business thou art come an thou seek to avenge thee for blood on any king he will take horse in thy service or an thou come in quest of aught wherein it is in his power to help thee he standeth up at thy service on account thereof so ardashir's father replied to the wazir saying o messenger return to thy lord and tell him that the most mighty king sayf ala'azam shah lord of shiraz had a son who hath been long absent from him and news of him have not come and all traces of him have been cut off an he be in this city he will take him and depart from you but if aught have befallen him or any mischief have ensued to him from you his father will lay waste your land and make spoil of your goods and slay your men and seize your women return therefore to thy lord in haste and tell him this ere evil befal him answered the minister to hear is to obey and turned to go away when the chamberlains cried out to him saying kiss ground kiss ground so he kissed the ground a score of times and rose not till his lifebreath was in his nostrils then he left the king's high court and returned to the city full of anxious thought concerning the affair of this king and the multitude of his troops and going in to king abd alkadir pale with fear and trembling in his sidemuscles acquainted him with that had befallen him and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and thirtysixth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir returned from the court of the great king pale with fear and with sidemuscles quivering for dread exceeding and acquainted his lord with that had befallen him hereat disquietude and terror for himself and for his people laid hold upon him and he said to the minister o wazir and who is this king's son replied the other 'tis even he whom thou badest put to death but praised be allah who hastened not his slaughter else had his father wasted our lands and spoiled our good quoth the king see now thy corrupt judgment in that thou didst counsel us to slay him where is the young man the son of yonder magnanimous king and quoth the wazir o mighty king thou didst command him be put to death when the king heard this he was clean distraught and cried out from his heart's core and inmost of head saying woe to you fetch me the heads man forthright lest death fall on him so they fetched the sworder and he said  king of the age i have smitten off his head even as thou badest me cried abd alkadir o dog an this be true i will assuredly send thee after him the heads man replied o king thou didst command me to slay him without consulting thee a second time said the king i was in my wrath but speak the truth ere thou lose thy life and said the sworder o king he is yet in the chains of life at this abd alkadir rejoiced and his heart was set at rest then he called for ardashir and when he came he stood up to receive him and kissed his mouth saying o my son i ask pardon of allah almighty for the wrong i have done thee and say thou not aught that may lower my credit with thy sire the great king the prince asked o king of the age and where is my father and the other answered he is come hither on thine account thereupon quoth ardashir by thy worship i will not stir from before thee till i have cleared my honour and the honour of thy daughter from that which thou laidest to our charge for she is a pure virgin send for the midwives and let them examine her before thee an they find her maidenhead gone i give thee leave to shed my blood and if they find her a clean maid her innocence of dishonour and mine also will be made manifest so he summoned the midwives who examined the princess and found her a pure virgin and so told the king seeking largesse of him he gave them what they sought putting off his royal robes to bestow on them and in like manner he was bountiful to all who were in the harim and they brought forth the scentcups and perfumed all the lords of estate and grandees and not one but rejoiced with exceeding joy then the king threw his arms about ardashir's neck and entreated him with all worship and honour bidding his chief eunuchs bear him to the bath when he came out he cast over his shoulders a costly robe and crowned him with a coronet of jewels he also girt him with a girdle of silk purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems and mounted him on one of his noblest mares with selle and trappings of gold inlaid with pearls and jewels then he bade his grandees and captains mount on his service and escort him to his father's presence and charged him tell his sire that king abd alkadir was at his disposal hearkening to and obeying him in whatso he should bid or forbid i will not fail of this answered ardashir and farewelling him repaired to his father who at sight of him was transported for delight and springing up advanced to meet him and embraced him whilst joy and gladness spread among all the host of the great king then came the wazirs and chamberlains and captains and guards and kissed the ground before the prince and rejoiced in his coming and it was a great day with them for enjoyment for the king's son gave leave to those of king abd alkadir's officers who had accompanied him and others of the townsfolk to view the ordinance of his father's host without let or stay so they might know the multitude of the great king's troops and the might of his empire and all who had seen him selling stuffs in the linendrapers' bazar marvelled how his soul could have consented thereto considering the nobility of his spirit and the loftiness of his dignity but it was his love and inclination to the king's daughter that to this had constrained him meanwhile news of the multitude of her lover's troops came to hayat alnufus who was still jailed by her sire's commandment till they knew what he should order respecting her whether pardon and release or death and burning and she looked down from the terraceroof of the palace and turning towards the mountains saw even these covered with armed men when she beheld all those warriors and knew that they were the army of ardashir's father she feared lest he should be diverted from her by his sire and forget her and depart from her whereupon her father would slay her so she called a handmaid that was with her in her apartment by way of service and said to her go to ardashir son of the great king and fear not when thou comest into his presence kiss the ground before him and tell him what thou art and say to him 'my lady saluteth thee and would have thee to know that she is a prisoner in her father's palace awaiting his sentence whether he be minded to pardon her or put her to death and she beseecheth thee not to forget her or forsake her for today thou art allpowerful and in whatso thou commandest no man dare cross thee wherefore an it seem good to thee to rescue her from her sire and take her with thee it were of thy bounty for indeed she endureth all these trials for thy sake but an this seem not good to thee for that thy desire of her is at an end still speak to thy sire so haply he may intercede for her with her father and he depart not till he have made him set her free and taken surety from and made covenant with him that he will not go about to put her to death nor work her aught of harm this is her last word to thee may allah not desolate her of thee and so the peace'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and thirtyseventh nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the bondmaid sent by hayat alnufus made her way to ardashir and delivered him her lady's message which when he heard he wept with sore weeping and said to her know that hayat alnufus is my mistress and that i am her slave and the captive of her love i have not forgotten what was between us nor the bitterness of the parting day so do thou say to her after thou hast kissed her feet that i will speak with my father of her and he shall send his wazir who sought her aforetime in marriage for me to demand her hand once more of her sire for he dare not refuse so if he send to her to consult her let her make no opposition for i will not return to my country without her then the handmaid returned to hayat alnufus and kissing her hands delivered to her the message which when she heard she wept for very joy and returned thanks to almighty allah such was her case but as regards ardashir he was alone with his father that night and the great king questioned him of his case whereupon he told him all that had befallen him first and last then quoth the king what wilt thou have me do for thee o my son an thou desire abd alkadir's ruin i will lay waste his lands and spoil his hoards and dishonour his house replied ardashir i do not desire that o my father for he hath done nothing to me deserving thereof but i wish for union with her wherefore i beseech thee of thy favour to make ready a present for her father but let it be a magnificent gift and send it to him by thy minister the man of just judgment quoth the king i hear and consent and sending for the treasures he had laid up from time past brought out all manner precious things and showed them to his son who was pleased with them then he called his wazir and bade him bear the present with him to king abd alkadir and demand his daughter in marriage for ardashir saying accept the present and return him a reply now from the time of ardashir's departure king abd alkadir had been troubled and ceased not to be heavy at heart fearing the laying waste of his reign and the spoiling of his realm when behold the wazir came in to him and saluting him kissed ground before him he rose up standing and received him with honour but the minister made haste to fall at his feet and kissing them cried pardon o king of the age the like of thee should not rise to the like of me for i am the least of servants' slaves know o king that prince ardashir hath acquainted his father with some of the favours and kindnesses thou hast done him wherefore he thanketh thee and sendeth thee in company of thy servant who standeth before thee a present saluting thee and wishing thee especial blessings and prosperities abd alkadir could not believe what he heard of the excess of his fear till the wazir laid the present before him when he saw it to be such gift as no money could purchase nor could one of the kings of the earth avail to the like thereof wherefore he was belittled in his own eyes and springing to his feet praised almighty allah and glorified him and thanked the prince then said the minister to him o noble king give ear to my word and know that the great king sendeth to thee desiring thine alliance and i come to thee seeking and craving the hand of thy daughter the chaste dame and treasured gem hayat alnufus in wedlock for his son ardashir wherefore if thou consent to this proposal and accept of him do thou agree with me for her marriageportion abd alkadir hearing these words replied i hear and obey for my part i make no objection and nothing can be more pleasurable to me but the girl is of full age and reason and her affair is in her own hand so be assured that i will refer it to her and she shall choose for herself then he turned to the chief eunuch and bade him go and acquaint the princess with the event so he repaired to the harim and kissing the princess's hands acquainted her with the great king's offer adding what sayest thou in answer i hear and i obey replied sheand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and thirtyeighth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the chief eunuch of the harim having informed the princess how she had been demanded in marriage by the great king and having heard her reply i hear and i obey returned therewith to the king and gave him this answer whereat he rejoiced with exceeding joy and calling for a costly robe of honour threw it over the wazir's shoulders furthermore he ordered him ten thousand dinars and bade him carry the answer to the great king and crave leave for him to pay him a visit hearing and obeying answered the minister and returning to his master delivered him the reply and abd alkadir's message and repeated all their talk whereat he rejoiced greatly and ardashir was transported for delight and his breast broadened and he was a most happy man king sayf ala'azam also gave king abd alkadir leave to come forth to visit him so on the morrow he took horse and rode to the camp of the great king who came to meet him and saluting him seated him in the place of honour and gave him welcome and they two sat whilst ardashir stood before them then arose an orator of the king abd alkadir's court and pronounced an eloquent discourse giving the prince joy of the attainment of his desire and of his marriage with the princess a queen among king's daughters when he sat down the great king caused bring a chest full of pearls and gems together with fifty thousand dinars and said to king abd alkadir i am my son's deputy in all that concerneth this matter so abd alkadir acknowledged receipt of the marriageportion and amongst the rest fifty thousand dinars for the nuptial festivities after which they fetched the kazis and the witnesses who wrote out the contract of marriage between the prince and princess and it was a notable day wherein all lovers made merry and all haters and enviers were mortified they spread the marriagefeasts and banquets and lastly ardashir went in unto the princess and found her a jewel which had been hidden an union pearl unthridden and a filly that none but he had ridden so he notified this to his sire then king sayf ala'azam asked his son hast thou any wish thou wouldst have fulfilled ere we depart and he answered yes o king know that i would fain take my wreak of the wazir who entreated us on evil wise and the eunuch who forged a lie against us so the king sent forthright to abd alkadir demanding of him the minister and the castrato whereupon he despatched them both to him and he commanded to hang them over the city gate after this they abode a little while and then sought of abd alkadir leave for his daughter to equip her for departure so he equipped her and mounted her in a takhtrawan a travelling litter of red gold inlaid with pearls and gems and drawn by noble steeds she carried with her all her waitingwomen and eunuchs as well as the nurse who had returned after her flight and resumed her office then king sayf ala'azam and his son mounted and abd alkadir mounted also with all the lords of his land to take leave of his soninlaw and daughter and it was a day to be reckoned of the goodliest of days after they had gone some distance the great king conjured abd alkadir to turn back so he farewelled him and his son after he had strained him to his breast and kissed him between the eyes and thanked him for his grace and favours and commended his daughter to his care then he went in to the princess and embraced her and she kissed his hands and they wept in the standingplace of parting after this he returned to his capital and ardashir and his company fared on till they reached shiraz where they celebrated the marriage festivities anew and they abode in all comfort and solace and joyance of life till there came to them the destroyer of delights and severer of societies the depopulator of

Roughing It (Chap. 73),Mark Twain,roughing it chap  lyricsat noon we hired a kanaka to take us down to the ancient ruins at honaunan in his canoeprice two dollarsreasonable enough for a sea voyage of eight miles counting both waysthe native canoe is an irresponsible looking contrivance i cannot think of anything to liken it to but a boy's sled runner hollowed out and that does not quite convey the correct idea it is about fifteen feet long high and pointed at both ends is a foot and a half or two feet deep and so narrow that if you wedged a fat man into it you might not get him out again it sits on top of the water like a duck but it has an outrigger and does not upset easily if you keep still this outrigger is formed of two long bent sticks like plow handles which project from one side and to their outer ends is bound a curved beam composed of an extremely light wood which skims along the surface of the water and thus saves you from an upset on that side while the outrigger's weight is not so easily lifted as to make an upset on the other side a thing to be greatly feared still until one gets used to sitting perched upon this knifeblade he is apt to reason within himself that it would be more comfortable if there were just an outrigger or so on the other side also i had the bow seat and billings sat amidships and faced the kanaka who occupied the stern of the craft and did the paddling with the first stroke the trim shell of a thing shot out from the shore like an arrow there was not much to see while we were on the shallow water of the reef it was pastime to look down into the limpid depths at the large bunches of branching coralthe unique shrubbery of the sea we lost that though when we got out into the dead blue water of the deep but we had the picture of the surf then dashing angrily against the crag bound shore and sending a foaming spray high into the airthere was interest in this beetling border too for it was honeycombed with quaint caves and arches and tunnels and had a rude semblance of the dilapidated architecture of ruined keeps and castles rising out of the restless sea when this novelty ceased to be a novelty we turned our eyes shoreward and gazed at the long mountain with its rich green forests stretching up into the curtaining clouds and at the specks of houses in the rearward distance and the diminished schooner riding sleepily at anchor and when these grew tiresome we dashed boldly into the midst of a school of huge beastly porpoises engaged at their eternal game of arching over a wave and disappearing and then doing it over again and keeping it upalways circling over in that way like so many well submerged wheels but the porpoises wheeled themselves away and then we were thrown upon our own resources it did not take many minutes to discover that the sun was blazing like a bonfire and that the weather was of a melting temperature it had a drowsing effect tooin one place we came upon a large company of naked natives of both sexes and all ages amusing themselves with the national pastime of surfbathing each heathen would paddle three or four hundred yards out to sea taking a short board with him then face the shore and wait for a particularly prodigious billow to come along at the right moment he would fling his board upon its foamy crest and himself upon the board and here he would come whizzing by like a bombshell it did not seem that a lightning express train could shoot along at a more hairlifting speed i tried surfbathing once subsequently but made a failure of it i got the board placed right and at the right moment too but missed the connection myselfthe board struck the shore in three quarters of a second without any cargo and i struck the bottom about the same time with a couple of barrels of water in me none but natives ever master the art of surfbathing thoroughlyat the end of an hour we had made the four miles and landed on a level point of land upon which was a wide extent of old ruins with many a tall cocoanut tree growing among them here was the ancient city of refugea vast inclosure whose stone walls were twenty feet thick at the base and fifteen feet high an oblong square a thousand and forty feet one way and a fraction under seven hundred the other within this inclosure in early times has been three rude temples each two hundred and ten feet long by one hundred wide and thirteen highin those days if a man killed another anywhere on the island the relatives were privileged to take the murderer's life and then a chase for life and liberty beganthe outlawed criminal flying through pathless forests and over mountain and plain with his hopes fixed upon the protecting walls of the city of refuge and the avenger of blood following hotly after himsometimes the race was kept up to the very gates of the temple and the panting pair sped through long files of excited natives who watched the contest with flashing eye and dilated nostril encouraging the hunted refugee with sharp inspiriting ejaculations and sending up a ringing shout of exultation when the saving gates closed upon him and the cheated pursuer sank exhausted at the threshold but sometimes the flying criminal fell under the hand of the avenger at the very door when one more brave stride one more brief second of time would have brought his feet upon the sacred ground and barred him against all harm where did these isolated pagans get this idea of a city of refugethis ancient oriental customthis old sanctuary was sacred to alleven to rebels in arms and invading armies once within its walls and confession made to the priest and absolution obtained the wretch with a price upon his head could go forth without fear and without dangerhe was tabu and to harm him was death the routed rebels in the lost battle for idolatry fled to this place to claim sanctuary and many were thus savedclose to the corner of the great inclosure is a round structure of stone some six or eight feet high with a level top about ten or twelve in diameter this was the place of execution a high palisade of cocoanut piles shut out the cruel scenes from the vulgar multitude here criminals were killed the flesh stripped from the bones and burned and the bones secreted inholes in the body of the structure if the man had been guilty of a high crime the entire corpse was burnedthe walls of the temple are a study the same food for speculation that is offered the visitor to the pyramids of egypt he will find herethe mystery of how they were constructed by a people unacquainted with science and mechanics the natives have no invention of their own for hoisting heavy weights they had no beasts of burden and they have never even shown any knowledge of the properties of the lever yet some of the lava blocks quarried out brought over rough broken ground and built into this wall six or seven feet from the ground are of prodigious size and would weigh tons how did they transport and how raise themboth the inner and outer surfaces of the walls present a smooth front and are very creditable specimens of masonry the blocks are of all manner of shapes and sizes but yet are fitted together with the neatest exactness the gradual narrowing of the wall from the base upward is accurately preservedno cement was used but the edifice is firm and compact and is capable of resisting storm and decay for centuries who built this temple and how was it built and when are mysteries that may never be unraveled outside of these ancient walls lies a sort of coffinshaped stone eleven feet four inches long and three feet square at the small end it would weigh a few thousand pounds which the high chief who held sway over this district many centuries ago brought thither on his shoulder one day to use as a lounge this circumstance is established by the most reliable traditions he used to lie down on it in his indolent way and keep an eye on his subjects at work for him and see that there was no soldiering done and no doubt there was not any done to speak of because he was a man of that sort of build that incites to attention to business on the part of an employeehe was fourteen or fifteen feet high when he stretched himself at full length on his lounge his legs hung down over the end and when he snored he woke the dead these facts are all attested by irrefragable traditionon the other side of the temple is a monstrous seventon rock eleven feet long seven feet wide and three feet thick it is raised a foot or a foot and a half above the ground and rests upon half a dozen little stony pedestals the same old fourteenfooter brought it down from the mountain merely for fun he had his own notions about fun and propped it up as we find it now and as others may find it a century hence for it would take a score of horses to budge it from its position they say that fifty or sixty years ago the proud queen kaahumanu used to fly to this rock for safety whenever she had been making trouble with her fierce husband and hide under it until his wrath was appeased but these kanakas will lie and this statement is one of their ablest effortsfor kaahumanu was six feet highshe was bulkyshe was built like an oxand she could no more have squeezed herself under that rock than she could have passed between the cylinders of a sugar mill what could she gain by it even if she succeeded to be chased and abused by a savage husband could not be otherwise than humiliating to her high spirit yet it could never make her feel so flat as an hour's repose under that rock wouldwe walked a mile over a raised macadamized road of uniform width a road paved with flat stones and exhibiting in its every detail a considerable degree of engineering skill some say that that wise old pagan kamehameha i planned and built it but others say it was built so long before his time that the knowledge of who constructed it has passed out of the traditions in either case however as the handiwork of an untaught and degraded race it is a thing of pleasing interest the stones are worn and smooth and pushed apart in places so that the road has the exact appearance of those ancient paved highways leading out of rome which one sees in picturesthe object of our tramp was to visit a great natural curiosity at the base of the foothillsa congealed cascade of lava some old forgotten volcanic eruption sent its broad river of fire down the mountain side here and it poured down in a great torrent from an overhanging bluff some fifty feet high to the ground below the flaming torrent cooled in the winds from the sea and remains there today all seamed and frothed and rippled a petrified niagara it is very picturesque and withal so natural that one might almost imagine it still flowed a smaller stream trickled over the cliff and built up an isolated pyramid about thirty feet high which has the semblance of a mass of large gnarled and knotted vines and roots and stems intricately twisted and woven togetherwe passed in behind the cascade and the pyramid and found the bluff pierced by several cavernous tunnels whose crooked courses we followed a long distancetwo of these winding tunnels stand as proof of nature's mining abilities their floors are level they are seven feet wide and their roofs are gently arched their height is not uniform however we passed through one a hundred feet long which leads through a spur of the hill and opens out well up in the sheer wall of a precipice whose foot rests in the waves of the sea it is a commodious tunnel except that there are occasional places in it where one must stoop to pass under the roof is lava of course and is thickly studded with little lavapointed icicles an inch long which hardened as they dripped they project as closely together as the iron

"Arabian Nights, Vol. 8 (Chap. 5)",Richard F. Burton,arabian nights vol  chap  lyricsali nur aldin and miriam the girdlegirlthere was once in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before in the parts of cairo a merchant named tj aldn who was of the most considerable of the merchants and of the chiefs of the freeborn but he was given to travelling everywhere and loved to fare over wild and wold waterless lowland and stony waste and to journey to the isles of the seas in quest of dirhams and dinars wherefore he had in his time encountered dangers and suffered duresse of the way such as would grizzle little children and turn their black hair grey he was possessed of black slaves and mamelukes eunuchs and concubines and was the wealthiest of the merchants of his time and the goodliest of them in speech owning horses and mules and bactrian camels and dromedaries sacks great and small of size goods and merchandise and stuffs such as muslins of hums silks and brocades of ba'allak cotton of mery stuffs of india gauzes of baghdad burnouses of moorland and turkish white slaves and abyssinian castratos and grecian girls and egyptian boys and the coverings of his bales were silk with gold purfled fair for he was wealthy beyond compare furthermore he was rare of comeliness accomplished in goodliness and gracious in his kindliness even as one of his describers doth thus expressa merchant i spied whose lovers  were fighting in furious guisequoth he 'why this turmoil of people'  quoth i 'trader for those fine eyes'and saith another in his praise and saith well enough to accomplish the wish of himcame a merchant to pay us a visit  whose glance did my heart surprisequoth he 'what surprised thee so'  quoth i 'trader 'twas those fine eyes'now that merchant had a son called ali nur aldin as he were the full moon whenas it meeteth the sight on its fourteenth night a marvel of beauty and loveliness a model of form and symmetrical grace who was sitting one day as was his wont in his father's shop selling and buying giving and taking when the sons of the merchants girt him around and he was amongst them as moon among stars with brow flowerwhite and cheeks of rosy light in down the tenderest dight and body like alabasterbright even as saith of him the poet'describe me' a fair one said  said i 'thou art beauty's queen'and speaking briefest speech  'all charms in thee are seen'and as saith of him one of his describershis mole upon plain of cheek is like  ambergrscrumb on marble plateand his glances likest the sword proclaim  to all love's rebels 'the lord is great'the young merchants invited him saying o my lord nur aldin we wish thee to go this day apleasuring with us in such a garden and he answered wait till i consult my parent for i cannot go without his consent as they were talking behold up came taj aldin and his son looked at him and said o father mine the sons of the merchants have invited me to wend apleasuring with them in such a garden dost thou grant me leave to go his father replied yes o my son fare with them and gave him somewhat of money so the young men mounted their mules and asses and nur aldin mounted a shemule and rode with them to a garden wherein was all that sould desireth and that eye charmeth it was high of walls which from broad base were seen to rise and it had a gateway vaultwise with a portico like a saloon and a door azure as the skies as it were one of the gates of paradise the name of the doorkeeper was rizwn and over the gate were trained an hundred trellises which grapes overran and these were of various dyes the red like coralline the black like the snouts of sdnmen and the white like egg of the pigeonhen and in it peach and pomegranate were shown and pear apricot and pomegranate were grown and fruits with and without stone hanging in clusters or aloneand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and sixtyfourth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the sons of the merchants entered the vergier they found therein all that soul desireth or eye charmeth grapes of many hues grown hanging in bunches or alone even as saith of them the poetgrapes tasting with the taste of wine  whose coats like blackest raven's shinetheir sheen amid the leafage shows  like women's fingers henna'd fineand as saith another on the same themegrapebunches likest as they sway  astalk my body frail and snellhoney and water thus in jar  when sourness past make hydromelthen they entered the arbour of the garden and say there rizwan the gatekeeper sitting as he were rizwan the paradiseguardian and on the door were written these linesgarth heavenwatered wherein clusters waved  on boughs which full of sap to bend were fainand when the branches danced on zephyr's palm  the pleiads shower'd as gifts fresh pearls for rainand within the arbour were written these two coupletscome with us friend and enter thou  this garth that cleanses rust of griefover their skits the zephyrs trip  and flowers in sleeve to laugh are liefso they entered and found all manner fruits in view and birds of every kind and hue such as ringdove nightingale and curlew and the turtle and the cushat sang their love lays on the sprays therein were rills that ran with limpid wave and flowers suave and bloom for whose perfume we crave and it was even as saith of it the poet in these two coupletsthe zephyr breatheth o'er its branches like  fair girls that trip as in fair skirts they paceits rills resemble swords in hands of knights  drawn from the scabbard and containingcaseand again as singeth the songsterthe streamlet swings by branchy wood and aye  joys in itsbreast those beauties to displayand zephyr noting this for jealousy  hastens and bends the branches other wayon the trees of the garden were all manner fruits each in two sorts amongst them the pomegranate as it were a ball of silverdross whereof saith the poet and saith right wellgranados of finest skin like the breasts  of maidfirmstanding in sight of malewhen i strip the skin they at once display  the rubies compelling all sense to quailand even as quoth another bardclose prest appear to him who views th' inside  red rubies in brocaded skirts bedightgranado i compare with marble dome  or virgin's breasts delighting every sighttherein is cure for every ill as e'en  left an hads the prophet pure of spriteand allah glorify his name eke deigned  a noble say in holy book inditethe apples were the sugared and the musky and the dmni amazing the beholder whereof saith hassan the poetapple which joins hues twain and brings to mind  the cheek of lover and beloved combinedtwo wondrous opposites on branch they show  this dark and that with hue incarnadinedthe twain embraced when spied the spy and turned  this red that yellow for the shame designedthere also were apricots of various kinds almond and camphor andjlni and 'antbi wereof saith the poetand almondapricot suggesting swain  whose lover's visit all his wits hath ta'enenough of lovesick lovers' plight it shows  of face deep yellow and heart torn in twainand saith another and saith welllook at that apricot whose bloom contains  gardens with brightness gladding all men's eynelike stars the blossoms sparkle when the boughs  are clad in foliage dight with sheen and shinethere likewise were plums and cherries and grapes that the sick of all diseases assain and do away giddiness and yellow choler from the brain and figs the branches between varicoloured red and green amazing sight and sense even as saith the poet'tis as the figs with clear white skins outthrown  by foliaged trees athwart whose green they peepwere sons of roum that guard the palaceroof  when shades close in and nightlong ward they keepand saith another and saith wellwelcome the fig to us it comes  ordered in handsome plates they bringlikest a surfahcloth we draw  to shape of bag without a ringand how well saith a thirdgive me the fig sweetflavoured beautyclad  whose inner beauties rival outer sheenand when it fruits thou tastest it to find  chamomile's scent and sugar's saccharineand eke it favoureth on platters poured  puffballs of silken thread and sendal greenand how excellent is the saying of one of themquoth they and i had trained my taste thereto  nor cared for other fruits whereby they swore'why lovest so the fig' whereto quoth i  'some men love fig and others sycamore'and are yet goodlier those of anotherpleaseth me more the fig than every fruit  when ripe and hanging from the sheeny boughlike devotee who when the clouds pour rain  sheds tears and allah's power doth avowand in that garth were also pears of various kinds sinatic aleppine and grecian growing in clusters and alone parcel green and parcel goldenand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and sixtyfifth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the merchants' sons went down into the garth they saw therein all the fruits we mentioned and found pears sinatic aleppine and grecian of every hue which here clustering there single grew parcel green and parcel yellow to the gazer a marvelview as saith of them the poetwith thee that pear agree whose hue amorn  is hue of hapless lover yellow palelike virgin cloistered strait in strong harm  whose face likeracing steed outstrips the veiland sultani peaches of shades varied yellow and red whereof saith the poetlike peach in vergier growing  and sheen of andamshowingwhose balls of yellow gold  are dyed with bloodgouts flowingthere were also green almonds of passing sweetness resembling the cabbage of the palmtree with their kernels within three tunics lurking of the munificent king's handiworking even as is said of themthree coats yon freshest form endue  god's work of varied shape and huehardness surrounds it night and day  prisoning without a sin to rueand as well saith anotherseest not that almond plucked by hand  of man from bough where wont to dwellpeeling it shows the heart within  as unionpearl in oyster shelland as saith a third better than hehow good is almond green i view  the smallest fills the hand of youits nap is as the down upon  the cheeks where yet no beardlet grewits kernels in the shell are seen  or bachelors or married twoas pearls they were of lucent white  casd and lapped in jasper's hueand as saith yet another and saith wellmine eyes ne'er looked on aught the almond like  for charms when blossoms in the prime show brightits head to hoariness of age inclines  the while its cheek by youth's fresh down is dightand jujubeplums of various colours grown in clusters and alone whereof saith one describing themlook at the lotetree note on boughs arrayed  like goodly apricots on reedstrown floortheir morninghue to viewer's eye is like  cascavels cast of purest golden oreand as saith another and saith right wellthe jujubetree each day  robeth in bright arrayas though each pome thereon  would self to sight displaylike falconbell of gold  swinging from every sprayand in that garth grew blood oranges as they were thekhaulanjn whereof quoth the enamoured poetred fruits that fill the hand and shine with sheen  of fire albe the scarfskin's white as snow'tis marvel snow on fire doth never melt  and stranger still ne'er burns this living loweand quoth another and quoth welland trees of orange fruiting ferly fair  to those who straitesthave their charms surveyedlike cheeks of women who their forms have decked  for holiday in robes of gold brocadeand yet another as welllike are the orangehills when zephyr breathes  swayingthe boughs and spray with airy graceher cheeks that glow with lovely light when met  at greetingtide by cheeks of other faceand a fourth as fairlyand fairest fawn we said to him 'portray  this garth and oranges thine eyes survey'and he 'your garden favoureth my face  who gathereth orange gathereth fire alway'in that garden too grew citrons in colour as virgin gold hanging down from on high and dangling among the branches as they were ingots of growing gold and saith thereof the 'namoured poethast seen a citroncopse so weighed adown  thou fearest bending roll their fruit on mouldand seemed when zephyr passed athwart the tree  its branches hung with bells of purest goldand shaddocks that among their boughs hung laden as though each were the breast of a gazellelike maiden contenting the most longing wight as saith of them the poet and saith arightand shaddock mid the gardenpaths on bough  freshest like fairest damsel met my sightand to the blowing of the breeze it bent  like golden ball to bat of chrysoliteand the lime sweet of scent which resembleth a hen's egg but its yellowness ornamenteth its ripe fruit and its fragrance hearteneth him who plucketh it as saith the poet who singeth itseest not the lemon when it taketh form  catch rays of light and all to gaze constrainlike egg of pullet which the huckster's hand  adorneth dyeing with the saffronstainmoreover in this garden were all manner of other fruits and sweetscented herbs and plants and fragrant flowers such as jessamine and henna and waterlilies and spikenard and roses of every kind and plantain and myrtle and so forth and indeed it was without compare seeming as it were a piece of paradise to whoso beheld it if a sick man entered it he came forth from it like a raging lion and tongue availeth not to its description by reason of that which was therein of wonders and rarities which are not found but in heaven and how should it be otherwise when its doorkeeper's name was rizman though widely different were the stations of those twain now when the sons of the merchants had walked about gazing at the garden after taking their pleasure therein they say down in one of its pavilions and seated nur aldin in their midstand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and sixtysixth nightshe resume it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the sons of the merchants sat down in the pavilion they seated nur aldin in their midst on a rug of goldpurfled leather of altif leaning on a pillow of minever stuffed with ostrich down and they gave him a fan of ostrich feathers whereon were written these two coupletsa fan whose breath is fraught with fragrant scent  minding of happy days and times forspentwafting at every time its perfumed air  o'er face of noble youth on honour bentthen they laid by their turbands and outer clothes and sat talking and chatting and inducing one another to discourse while they all kept their eyes fixed on nur aldin and gazed on his beauteous form after the sitting had lasted an hour or so up came a slave with a tray on his head wherein were platters of china and crystal containing viands of all sorts for one of the youths had so charged his people before coming to the garden and the meats were of whatever walketh earth or wingeth air or swimmeth waters such as katgrouse and fat quails and pigeonpoults and mutton and chickens and the delicatest fish so the tray being sat before them they fell to and ate their fill and when they had made an end of eating they rose from meat and washed their hands with pure water and muskscented soap and dried them with napery embroidered in silk and bugles but to nur aldin they brought a napkin laced with red gold whereon he wiped his hands then coffee was served up and each drank what he would after which they sat talking till presently the gardenkeeper who was young went away and returning with a basket full of roses said to them what say ye o my masters to flowers quoth one of them there is no harm in them especially roses which are not to be resisted answered the gardener 'tis well but it is of our wont not to give roses but in exchange for pleasant converse so whoever would take aught thereof let him recite some verses suitable to the situation now they were ten sons of merchants of whom one said agreed give me thereof and i will recite thee somewhat of verse apt to the case accordingly the gardener gave him a bunch of roses which he took and at once improvised these three coupletsthe rose in highest stead i rate  for that her charms ne'er satiateall fragrant flow'rs be troops to her  their general of high estatewhere she is not they boast and vaunt  but when she comes they stint their pratethen the gardener gave a bunch to another and he recited these two coupletstake o my lord to thee the rose

coupletsseest not that rosery where rose aflowering displays  mounted upon her steed of stalk those marvels manifoldas though the bud were rubystone and girded all around  with chrysolite and held within a little hoard of goldthen he gave a posy to a fifth and he recited these two coupletswands of green chrysolite bare issue which  were fruits like ingots of the growing goldand drops a dropping from its leaves were like  the tears my languorous eyelids railed and rolledthen he gave a sixth a bunch and he recited these two coupletso rose thou rare of charms that dost contain  all gifts and

'what gars thy thorns to be put forth  for all who touch thee cruellest injury'quoth she 'these flowery troops are troops of me  who be their lord with spines for armoury'and he gave an eighth a bunch

rose and her arming thorn  to emerald lance piercing golden shieldand whilst each one hent bunch in hand the gardener brought the wineservice and setting it before them on a tray of porcelain arabesqued with red gold recited these two coupletsdawn heralds daylight so wine pass round  old wine fooling sage till his wits he tynewot i not for its purest clarity  an 'tis wine in cup or 'tis cup in winethen the gardener filled and drank and the cup went round till it came to nur aldin's turn whereupon the man filled and handed it to him but he said this thing i wot it not nor have i ever drunken thereof for therein is great offence and the lord of allmight hath forbidden it in his book answered the gardener o my lord nur aldin an thou forbear to drink only by reason of the sin verily allah extolled and exalted be he is bountiful of sufferance great forgiving and compassionate and pardoneth the mortalest sins his mercy embraceth all things allah's ruth be upon the poet who saith'be as thou wilt for allah is bountiful  and when thou sinnest feel thou naught alarmbut 'ware of twofold sins nor ever dare  to give god partner or mankind to harm'then quoth one of the sons of the merchants my life on thee o my lord nur aldin drink of this cup and another conjured him by the oath of divorce and yet another stood up persistently before him till he was ashamed and taking the cup from the gardener drank a draught but spat it out again crying 'tis bitter said the young gardener o my lord nur aldin knowest thou not that sweets taken by way of medicine are bitter were this not bitter 'twould lack of the manifold virtues it possesseth amongst which are that it digesteth food and disperseth cark and care and dispelleth flatulence and clarifieth the blood and cleareth the complexion and quickeneth the body and hearteneth the henhearted and fortifieth the sexual power in man but to name all its virtues would be tedious quoth one of the poets'we'll drink and allah pardon sinners all  and cure of ills by sucking cups i'll findnor aught the sin deceives me yet said he  'in it there be advantage to mankind'then he sprang up without stay or delay and opened one of the cupboards in the pavilion and taking out a loaf of refined sugar broke off a great slice which he put into nur aldin's cup saying o my lord an thou fear to drink wine because of its bitterness drink now for 'tis sweet so he took the cup and emptied it whereupon one of his comrades filled him another saying o my lord nur aldin i am thy slave and another did the like saying i am one of thy servants and a third said for my sake and a fourth allah upon thee o my lord nur aldin heal my heart and so they ceased not plying him with wine each and every of the ten sons of merchants till they had made him drink a total of ten cups now nur aldin's body was virgin of winebibbing or never in all his life had he drunken vinejuice till that hour wherefore its fumes wrought in his brain and drunkenness was stark upon him and he stood up and indeed his tongue was thick and his speech stammering and said o company by allah ye are fair and your speech is goodly and your place pleasant but there needeth hearing of sweet music for drink without melody lacks the chief of its essentiality even as saith the poet'pass round the cup to the old and the young man too and take the bowl from the hand of the shining moonbut without music i charge you forbear to drink i see even horses drink to a whistled tune'therewith up sprang the gardener lad and mounting one of the young men's mules was absent awhile after which he returned with a cairene girl as she were a sheep's tail fat and delicate or an ingot of pure silvern ore or a dinar on a porcelain plate or a gazelle in the wold forlore she had a face that put to shame the shining sun and eyes babylonian and brows like bows bended and cheeks rosepainted and teeth pearlyhued and lips sugared and glances languishing and breast ivory white and body slender and slight full of folds and with dimples dight and hips like pillows stuffed and thighs like columns of syrian stone and between them what was something like a sachet of spices in wrapper swathed quoth the poet of her in these coupletshad she shown her shape to idolaters' sight  they would gaze on her face and their gods detestand if in the east to a monk she'd show'd  he'd quit eastern posture and bow to westan she crached in the sea and the briniest sea  her lips would give it the sweetest zestand quoth another in these coupletsbrighter than moon at full with kohl'd eyes she came  like doe on chasing whelps of lioness intenther night of murky locks lets fall a tent on her  a tent of hair that lacks no pegs to hold the tentand roses lighting up her roseate cheeks are fed  by hearts and livers flowing fire for languishmentan 'spied her all the age's fair to her they'd rise  humbly and cry 'the meed belongs to precedent'and how well saith a third bardthree things for ever hinder her to visit us for fear of the intriguing spy and eke the rancorous envierher forehead's lustre and the sound of all her ornaments and the sweet scent her creases hold of ambergris and myrthgrant with the border of her sleeve she hide her brow and doff her ornaments how shall she do her scent away from hershe was like the moon when at fullest on its fourteenth night and was clad in a garment of blue with a veil of green overbrown flowerwhite that all wits amazed and those of understanding amatedand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying his permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and sixtyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the gardener brought a girl whom we have described possessed of the utmost beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetrical grace as it were she the poet signified when he saidshe came apparelled in a vest of bluethat mocked the skies and shamed their azure huei thought thus clad she burst upon my sightlike summer moonshine on a wintry nightand how goodly is the saying of another and how excellentshe came thick veiled and cried i 'o display  that face like full moon bright with purewhite ray'quoth she 'i fear disgrace' quoth i 'cut short  this talk no shift of days thy thoughts affray'whereat she raised her veil from fairest face  and crystal spray on gems began to strayand i forsooth was fain to kiss her cheek  lest she complain of me on judgmentdayand at such tide before the lord on high  we first of lovers were redress to prayso 'lord prolong this reckoning and review'  prayed i 'that longer i may sight my may'then said the young gardener to her know thou o lady of the fair brighter than any constellation which illumineth air we sought in bringing thee hither naught but that thou shouldst entertain with converse this comely youth my lord nur aldin for he hath come to this place only this day and the girl replied would thou hadst told me that i might have brought what i have with me rejoined the gardener o my lady i will go and fetch it to thee as thou wilt said she and he give me a token so she gave him a kerchief and he fared forth in haste and returned after awhile bearing a green satin bag with slings of gold the girl took the bag from him and opening it shook it whereupon there fell thereout twoandthirty pieces of wood which she fitted one into other male into female and female into male till they became a polished lute of indian workmanship then she uncovered her wrists and laying the lute in her lap bent over it with the bending of mother over babe and swept the strings with her fingertips whereupon it moaned and resounded and after its olden home yearned and it remembered the waters that gave it drink and the earth whence it sprang and wherein it grew and it minded the carpenters who made it their merchandise and the ships that shipped it and it cried and called aloud and moaned and groaned and it was as if she asked it of all these things and it answered her with the tongue of the case reciting these coupletsa tree whilere was i the bulbul's home  to whom for love i bowed my grassgreen headthey moaned on me and i their moaning learnt  and in that moan my secret all men readthe woodman fell me falling sans offence  and slender lute of me as view ye madebut when the fingers smite my strings they tell  how man despite my patience did me deadhence booncompanions when they hear my moan  distracted wax as though by wine misledand the lord softens every heart of me  and i am hurried to the highmost steadall who in charms excel fain clasp my waist  gazelles of languid eyne and houri maidallah ne'er part fond lover from his joy  nor live the loved one who unkindly fledthen the girl was silent awhile but presently taking the lute in lap again bent over it as mother bendeth over child and preluded in many different modes then returning to the first she sang these coupletswould they  the lover seek without ado  he to his heavy grief had bid adieuwith him had vied the nightingale on bough  as one far parted from his lover's viewrouse thee awake the moon lights unionnight  as tho' such union woke the morn anewthis day the blamers take of us no heed  and lutestrings bid us all our joys ensueseest not how fourfold things conjoin in one  rose myrtle scents and blooms of golden hueyea here this day the four chief joys unite  drink and dinars beloved and lover trueso win thy worldly joy for joys go past  and naught but storiedtales and legends lastwhen nur aldin heard the girl sing these lines he looked on her with eyes of love and could scarce contain himself for the violence of his inclination to her and on like wise was it with her because she glanced at the company who were present of the sons of the merchants and she saw that nur aldin was amongst the rest as moon among stars for that he was sweet of speech and replete with amorous grace perfect in stature and symmetry brightness and loveliness pure of all defect than the breeze of morn softer than tasnim blander as saith of him the poetby his cheeks' unfading damask and his smiling teeth i swear by the arros that he feathers with the witchery of his airby his sides so soft and tender and his glances bright and keen by the whiteness of his forehead and the blackness of his hairby his arched imperious eyebrows chasing slumber from my lids with their yeas and noes that hold me 'twixt rejoicing and despairby the scorpions that he launches from his ringletclustered brows seeking still to slay his lovers with his rigours unawareby the myrtle of his whiskers and the roses of his cheek by his lips' incarnate rubies and his teeth's fine pearls and rareby the straight and tender sapling of his shape which for its fruit doth the twin pomegranates shining in his snowy bosom wearby his heavy hips that tremble both in motion and repose and the slender waist above them all too slight their weight to bearby the silk of his apparel and his quick and sprightly wit by all attributes of beauty that are fallen to his sharelo the musk exhales its fragrance from his breath and eke the breeze from his scent the perfume borrows that it scatters everywhereyea the sun in all his splendour cannot with his brightness vie and the crescent moon's a fragment that he from his nails doth pareand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and sixtyeighth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that nur aldin was delighted with the girl's verses and he swayed from side to side for drunkenness and fell apraising her and sayinga lutanist to us inclined  and stole our wits bemused with wineand said to us her lute 'the lord  bade us discourse by voice divine'when she heard him thus improvise the girl gazed at him with loving eyes and redoubled in passion and desire for him increased upon her and indeed she marvelled at his beauty and loveliness symmetry and grace so that she could not contain herself but took the lute in lap again and sang these coupletshe blames me for casting on him my sight  and parts fro' me bearing my life and spritehe repels me but kens what my heart endures  as though allah himself had inspired the wighti portrayed his portrait in palm of hand  and cried to mine eyes 'weep your doleful plight'for neither shall eyes of me spy his like  nor my heart have patience to bear its blightwherefore will i tear thee from breast o heart  as one who regards him with jealous spiteand when say i 'o heart be consoled for pine'  'tis that heart to none other shall e'er inclinenur aldin wondered at the charms of her verse and the elegance of her expression and the sweetness of her voice and the eloquence of her speech and his wit fled for stress of love and longing and ecstasy and distraction so that he could not refrain from her a single moment but bent to her and strained her to his bosom and she in like manner bowed her form over his and abandoned herself to his embrace and bussed him between the eyes then he kissed her on the mouth and played with her at kisses after the manner of the billing of doves and she met him with like warmth and did with him as she was done by till the others were distracted and rose to their feet whereupon nur aldin was ashamed and held his hand from her then she took her lute and preluding thereon in manifold modes lastly returned to the first and sang these coupletsa moon when he bends him those eyes lay bare  a brand thatgars gazing gazelle despaira king rarest charms are

her verse he inclined to her for delight and could not contain himself for excess of wonderment so he recited these coupletsmethought she was the forenoon sun until she donned the veil  but lit she fire in vitals mine still flaring fierce and highhow had it hurt her an she deigned return my poor salm  with fingertips or e'en vouchsafed one little wink of eyethe cavalier who spied her face was wholly stupefied  by charms that glorify the place and every charm outvie'be this the fair who makes thee pine and long for love liesse  indeed thou art excused' 'this is my fairest she'quoth iwho shot me with the shaft of looks nor deigns to rue my woes  of strangerhood and broken heart and love i must abyi rose amorn with vanquished heart to longing love a prey  and weep i through the live long day and all the night i crythe girl marvelled at his eloquence and elegance and taking her lute smote thereon with the goodliest of performance repeating all the melodies and sang these coupletsby the life o' thy face o thou life o' my sprite  i'll ne'er leave thy love for despair or delightwhen art cruel thy vision stands hard by my side  and the thought of thee haunts me when far from sighto who saddenest my glance albe weeting that i  no love but thy love will for ever requitethy cheeks are of rose and thy lipsdews are wine  say wilt grudge them to us in this charming sitehereat nur aldin was gladdened with extreme gladness and wondered with the utmost wonder so he answered her verse with these coupletsthe sun yellowed not in the murk gloom li'en  but lay pearl enveiled 'neath horizonchinenor showed its crest to the eyes of morn  but took refuge from parting with morningshinetake my teardrops that trickle as chain on chain  and they'll tell my case with the clearest signan my tears be likened to nileflood like  malak's flooded flat be this love o'minequoth she 'bring thy riches' quoth i 'come take'  'and thy sleep' 'yes take it from lids of eyne'when the girl heard nur aldin's words and noted the beauty of his eloquence her senses fled and her wit was dazed and love of him gat hold upon her whole heart so she pressed him to her bosom and fell to kissing him like the billing of doves whilst he returned her caresses with successive kisses but preeminence appertaineth to precedence when she had made an end of kissing she took the lute and recited these coupletsalas alack and wellaway for blamer's calumny  whether or not i make my moan or plead or show no pleao spurner of my love i ne'er of thee so hard would deem  that i of thee should

'unless he deign to give us all a drink  of wine of fine old wine his lips deal in their puritywe to the lord of threefold worlds will pray to grant our prayer'  and all exclaim with single cry 'in thy name o ali'nur aldin hearing these lines and their rhyme marvelled at the fluency of her tongue and thanked her praising her grace and passing seductiveness and the damsel delighted at his praise arose without stay or delay and doffing that was upon her of outer dress and trinkets till she was free of all encumbrance sat down on his knees and kissed him between the eyes and on his cheekmole then she gave him all she had put offand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and sixtyninth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the girl gave to nur aldin all she had doffed saying o beloved of my heart in very sooth the gift is after the measure of the giver so he accepted this from her and gave it back to her and kissed her on the mouth and cheeks and eyes when this was ended and done for naught is durable save the living the eternal provider of the peacock and the owl nur aldin rose from the sance and stood upon his feet because the darkness was now fallen and the stars shone out whereupon quoth the damsel to him whither away o my lord and quoth he to my father's home then the sons of the merchants conjured him to night with them but he refused and mounting his shemule rode without stopping till he reached his parent's house where his mother met him and said to him o my son what hath kept thee away till this hour by allah thou hast troubled myself and thy sire by thine absence from us and our hearts have been occupied with thee then she came up to him to kiss him on his mouth and smelling the fumes of the wine said o my winebibber and a rebel against him to whom belong creation and commandment but nur aldin threw himself down on the bed and lay there presently in came his sire and said what aileth nur aldin to lie thus and his mother answered 'twould seem his head acheth for the air of the garden so taj aldin went up to his son to ask him of his ailment and salute him and smelt the reek of wine now the merchant loved not winedrinkers so he said to nur aldin woe to thee o my son is folly come to such a pass with thee that thou drinkest wine when nur aldin heard his sire say this he raised his hand being yet in his drunkenness and dealt him a buffet when by decree of the decreer the blow lit on his father's right eye which rolled down on his cheek whereupon he fell aswoon and lay therein awhile they sprinkled rosewater on him till he recovered when he would have beaten his son but the mother withheld him and he swore by the oath of divorce from his wife that as soon as morning morrowed he would assuredly cut off his son's right hand when she heard her husband's words her breast was straitened and she feared for he son and ceased not to soothe and appease his sire till sleep overcame him then she waited till moonrise when she went in to her son whose drunkenness had now departed from him and said to him o nur aldin what is this foul deed thou diddest with thy sire he asked and what did i with him and answered she thou dealtest him a buffet on the right eye and struckest it out so that it rolled down his cheek and he hath sworn by the divorceoath that as soon as morning shall morrow he will without fail cut off thy right hand nur aldin repented him of that he had done whenas repentance profited him naught and his mother sait to him o my son this penitence will not profit thee nor will aught avail thee but that thou arise forthwith and seek safety in flight go forth the house privily and take refuge with one of thy friends and there what allah shall do await for he changeth case after case and state upon state then she opened a chest and taking out a purse of an hundred dinars said o my son take these dinars and provide thy wants therewith and when they are at an end o my son send and let me know thereof that i may send thee other than these and at the same time covey to me news of thyself privily haply allah will decree thee relief and thou shalt return to thy home and she farewelled him and wept passing sore nought could be more thereupon nur aldin took the purse of gold and was about to go forth when he espied a great purse containing a thousand dinars which his mother had forgotten by the side of the chest so he took this also and binding the two purses about his middle set out before dawn threading the streets in the direction of blk where he arrived when day broke and all creatures arose attesting the unity of allah the opener and went forth each of them upon his several business to win that which allah had unto him allotted reaching bulak he walked on along the riverbank till he sighted a ship with her gangway out and her four anchors made fast to the land the folk were going up into her and coming down from her and nur aldin seeing some sailors there standing asked them whither they were bound and they answered to rosettacity quoth he take me with you and quoth they well come and welcome to thee to thee o goodly one so he betook himself forthright to the market and buying what he needed of vivers and bedding and covering returned to the port and went on board the ship which was ready to sail and tarried with him but a little while before she weighed anchor and fared on without stopping till she reached rosetta where nur aldin saw a small boat going to alexandria so he embarked in it and traversing the seaarm of rosetta fared on till he came to a bridge called aljm where he landed and entered alexandria by the gate called the gate of the lotetree allah protected him so that none of those who stood on guard at the gate saw him and he walked on till he entered the cityand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventieth nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when nur aldin entered alexandria he found it a city goodly of pleasaunces delightful to its inhabitants and inviting to inhabit therein winter had fared from it with his cold and prime was come to it with his roses its flowers were kindly ripe and welled forth its rills indeed it was a city goodly of ordinance and disposition its folk were of the best of men and when the gates thereof were shut its folk were safe and it was even as is said of it in these coupletsquoth i to a comrade one day  a man of good speech and rare'describe alexandria'  quoth he 'tis a marchtown fair'quoth i 'is there living therein'  and he 'an the wind blow there'or as saith one of the poetsalexandria's a frontier whose dews of lips are sweet and clearhow fair the coming to it is  so one therein no raven speernur aldin walked about the city and ceased not walking till her came to the merchants' bazar whence he passed on to the mart of the moneychangers and so on in turn to the markets of the confectioners and fruiterers and druggists marvelling as he went at the city for that the nature of its qualities accorded with its name as he walked in the druggists' bazar behold an old man came down from his shop and saluting him took him by the hand and carried him to his home and nur aldin saw a fair bystreet swept and sprinkled whereon the zephyr blew and made pleasantness pervade it and the leaves of the trees overshaded it therein stood three houses and at the upper end a mansion whose foundations were firm sunk in the water and its walls towered to the confines of the sky they had swept the space before it and they had sprinkled it freshly so it exhaled the fragrance of flowers borne on the zephyr which breathed upon the place and the scent met there who approached it on such wise as it were one of the gardens of paradise and as they had cleaned and cooed the bystreet's head so was the end of it with marble spread the shaykh carried nur aldin into the house and setting somewhat of food before him ate with his guest when they had made an end of eating the druggist said to him when camest thou hither from cairo and nur aldin replied this very night o my father quoth the old man what is thy name and quoth he ali nur aldin said the druggist o my son o nur aldin be the triple divorce incumbent on me an thou leave me so long as thou abidest in this city and i will set thee apart a place wherein thou mayst dwell nur aldin asked o my lord the shaykh let me know more of thee and the other answered know o my son that some years ago i went to cairo with merchandise which i sold there and bought other and i had occasion for a thousand dinars so thy sire taj aldin weighed them out for me all unknowing me and would take no written word of me but had patience with me till i returned hither and sent him the amount by one of my servants together with a gift i saw thee whilst thou wast little and if it please allah the most high i will repay thee somewhat of the kindness thy father did me when nur aldin heard the old man's story he showed joy and pulling out with a smile the purse of a thousand dinars gave it to his host the shaykh and said to him take charge of this deposit for me against i buy me somewhat of merchandise whereon to trade then he abode some time in alexandria city taking his pleasure every day in its thoroughfares eating and drinking ad indulging himself with mirth and merriment till he had made an end of the hundred dinars he had kept by way of spendingmoney whereupon he repaired to the old druggist to take of him somewhat of the thousand dinars to spend but found him not in his shop and took a seat therein to await his return he sat there gazing right and left and amusing himself with watching the merchants and passersby and as he was thus engaged behold there came into the bazar a persian riding on a shemule and carrying behind him a damsel as she were argent of alloy free or a fish balti in mimic sea or a doegazelle on desert lea her face outshone the sun in shine and she had witching eyne and breasts of ivory white teeth of marguerite slender waist and sides dimpled deep and calves like tails of fat sheep and indeed she was perfect in beauty and loveliness elegant stature and symmetrical grace even as saith one describing her'twas as by will of her she was create  nor short nor long but beauty's mould and materose blushes reddest when she sees those cheeks  and fruits the bough those marvel charms amatemoon is her favour musk the scent of her  branch is her shape she passeth man's estate'tis e'en as were she cast in freshest pearl  and every limblet shows a moon innatepresently the persian lighted down from his shemule and making the damsel also dismount loudly summoned the broker and said to him as soon as he came take this damsel and cry her for sale in the market so he took her and leading her to the middlemost of the bazar disappeared for a while and presently he returned with a stool of ebony inlaid with ivory and setting it upon the ground seated her thereon then he raised her veil and discovered a face as it were a median targe or a cluster of pearls and indeed she was like the full moon when it filleth on its fourteenth night accomplished in brilliant beauty as saith the poetvied the full moon for folly with her face  but was eclipsed and split for rage full soreand if the spiring bn with her contend  perish her hands who load of fuel boreand how well saith anothersay to the fair in the wroughten veil  how hast made that monklike worshipper aillight of veil and light of face under it  made the hosts of darkness to fly from baleand when came my glance to steal look at cheek  with a meteorshaft the guard made me quailthen said the broker to the merchants how much do ye bid for the unionpearl of the diver and prizequarry of the fowler quoth one she is mine for an hundred dinars and another said two hundred and a third three hundred and they ceased not to bid one against other till they made her price nine hundred and fifty dinars and there the biddings stopped awaiting acceptance and consentand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventyfirst nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the merchants bid one against other till they made the price of the girl nine hundred and fifty dinars then the broker went up to her persian master and said to him the biddings for this thy slavegirl have reached nine hundred and fifty dinars so say me wilt thou sell her at that price and take the money asked the persian doth she consent to this i desire to fall in with her wishes for i sickened on my journey hither and this handmaid tended me with all possible tenderness wherefore i sware not to sell her but to him whom she should like and approve and i have put her sale in her own hand so do thou consult her and if she say 'i consent' sell her to whom thou wilt but an she say 'no' sell her not so the broker went up to her and asked her o princess of fair ones know that thy master putteth thy sale in thine own hands and thy price hath reached nine hundred and fifty dinars dost thou give me leave to sell thee she answered show me him who is minded to buy me before clinching the bargain so he brought her up to one of the merchants a man stricken with years and decrepit and she looked at him a long while then turned to the broker and said to him o broker art thou jinnmad or afflicted in thy wit replied he why dost thou ask me this o princess of fair ones and said she is it permitted thee of allah to sell the like of me to yonder decrepit old man who saith of his wife's case these couplets'quoth she to meand sore enraged for wounded pride was she  for she in sooth had bidden me to that which might not be'an if thou swive me not forthright as one should swive his wife  thou be made a cuckold straight reproach it not to memeseems thy yard is made of wax for very flaccidness  for when i rub it with my hand it softens instantly'and said he likewise of his yard'i have a yard that sleeps in base and shameful way  when grants my lover boon for which i sue and praybut when i wake o' mornings all alone in bed  'tis fain o' foin and fence and fierce for futterplay'and again quoth he thereof of his yard'i have a froward yard of temper ill  dishonoring him who shows it most regardit stands when sleep i when i stand it sleeps  heaven pity not who pitieth that yard'when the old merchant heard this ill flouting from the damsel he was wroth with wrath exceeding beyond which was no proceeding and said to the broker o most illomened of brokers thou hast not brought into the market this illconditioned wench but to gibe me and make mock of me before the merchants then the broker took her aside and said to her o my lady be not wanting in selfrespect the shaykh at whom thou didst mock is the syndic of the bazar and inspector thereof and a committeeman of the council of the merchants but she laughed and improvised these two coupletsit behoveth folk who rule in our time  and 'tis one of the duties of magistrateshipto hand up the wali above his door  and beat with a whip the mohtasibadding by allah o my lord i will not be sold to yonder old man so sell me to other than him for haply he will be abashed at me and vend me again and i shall become a mere servant and it beseemeth not that i sully myself with menial service and indeed thou knowest that the matter of my sale is committed to myself he replied i hear and i obey and carried her to a man which was one of the chief merchants and when standing hard by him the broker asked how sayst thou o my lady shall i sell thee to my lord sharf aldn here for nine hundred and fifty gold pieces she looked at him and seeing him to be an old man with a dyed beard said to the broker art thou silly that thou wouldst sell me to this worn out father antic am i cotton refuse or threadbare rags that thou marchest me about from greybeard to greybeard each like a wall ready to fall or an ifrit smitten down of a fireball as for the first the poet had him in mind when he said'i sought of a fair maid to kiss her lips of coral red but 'no by him who fashioned things from nothingness' she saidunto the white of hoary hairs i never had a mind and shall my mouth be stuffed forsooth with cotton ere i'm dead'and how goodly is the saying of the poet'the wise have said that white of hair is light that shines and robes  the face of man with majesty and light that awes the sightyet until hoary seal shall stamp my partingplace of hair  i hope and pray that same may be black as the blackest nightalbe timewhitened beard of man be like the book he bears  when to his lord he must return i'd rather 'twere not white'and yet goodlier is the saying of another'a guest hath stolen on my head and honour may he lack  the sword a milder deed hath done that dared these locks to hackavaunt o whiteness wherein naught of brightness gladdens sight  thou 'rt blacker in the eyes of me than very blackest black'as for the other he is a model of wantonness and scurrilousness and a blackener of the face of hoariness his dye acteth the foulest of lies and the tongue of his case reciteth these lines'quoth she to me 'i see thou dy'st thy hoariness' and i 'i do but hide it from thy sight o thou mine ear and eye'she laughed out mockingly and said 'a wonder 'tis indeed thou so aboundest in deceit that even thy hair's a lie'and how excellent is the saying of the poet'o thou who dyest hoariness with black  that youth wi' thee abide at least in showlook ye my lot was dyd black whilome  and take my word none other hue 'twill grow'when the old man with dyed beard heard such words from the slavegirl he raged with exceeding rage in fury's last stage and said to the broker o most illomened of brokers this day thou hast brought to our market naught save this gibing baggage to flout at all who are therein one after other and fleer at them with flyting verse and idle jest and he came down from his shop and smote on the face the broker who took her an angered and carried her away saying to her by allah never in my life saw i a more shameless wench than thyself thou hast cut off my daily bread and thine own this day and all the merchants will bear me a grudge on thine account then they saw on the way a merchant called shihab aldin who bid ten dinars more for her and the broker asked her leave to sell her to him quoth she trot him out that i may see him and question him of a certain thing which if he have in his house i will be sold to him and if not then not so the broker left her standing there and going up to shihab aldin said to him o my lord know that yonder damsel tells me she hath a mind to ask thee somewhat which an thou have she will be sold to thee now thou hast heard what she said to thy fellows the merchantsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventysecond nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the broker said to the merchant thou hast heard what this handmaid said to thy fellows the traders and by allah i fear to bring her to thee lest she do with thee like as she did with thy neighbours and so i fall into disgrace with thee but an thou bid me bring her to thee i will bring her quoth the merchant hither with her to me hearing and obeying answered the broker and fetched for the purchaser the damsel who looked at him and said o my lord shihab aldin hast thou in thy house round cushions stuffed with ermine strips replied shihab aldin yes o princess of fair ones i have at home half a score such cushions but i conjure thee by allah tell me what will thou do with them quoth she i will bear with thee till thou be asleep when i will lay them on thy mouth and nose and press them down till thou die then she turned to the broker and said to him o thou refuse of brokers meseemeth thou art mad in that thou showest me this hour past first to a pair of greybeards in each of whom are two faults and then thou proferrest me to my lord shihab aldin wherein be three defects and thirdly he is dwarfish secondly he hath a nose which is big and thirdly he hath a beard which is long of him quoth one of the poets'we never heard of wight nor yet espied  who amid men three gifts hath unifiedto wit a beard one cubit long a snout  spanlong and figure tall a finger wide'and quoth another poet'from the plain of his face springs a minaret  like a bezel of ring on his finger setdid creation enter that vasty nose  no created thing would elsewhere be met'when shihab aldin heard this he came down from his shop and seized the broker by the collar saying o scurviest of brokers what aileth thee to bring us a damsel to flout and make mock of us one after other with her verses and talk that a curse is so the broker took her and carried her away from before him and fared saying by allah all my life long since i have plied this profession never set i eyes on the like of thee for unmannerliness nor aught more curst to me than thy star for thou hast cut off my livelihood this day and i have gained no profit by thee save cuffs on the necknape and catching by the collar then he brought her to the shop of another merchant owner of negro slaves and white servants and stationing her before him said to her wilt thou be sold to this my lord 'al aldn she looked at him and seeing him humpbacked said this is a gobbo and quoth the poet of him'drawn in thy shoulders are and spine thrust out  as seeking star which satan gave the loutor as he tasted had first smack of scourge  and looked in marvel for a second bout'and saith another on the same theme'as one of you who mounted mule  a sight for me to ridicule is 't not a farce who feels surprise  an start and bolt with him the mule'and another on a similar subject'oft hunchback addeth to his bunchy back  faults which gar folk upon his front look blacklike branch distort and dried by length of days  with citrons hanging from it loose and slack'with this the broker hurried up to her and carrying her to another merchant said to her wilt thou be sold to this one she looked at him and said in very sooth this man is blueeyed how wilt thou sell me to him quoth one of the poets'his eyelids sore and bleared  weakness of frame denotearise ye folk and see  within his eyes the mote'then the broker carried her to another and she looked at him and seeing that he had a long beard said to the broker fie upon thee this is a ram whose tail hath sprouted from his gullet wilt thou sell me to him o unluckiest of brokers hast thou not heard say 'all long of beard are little of wits indeed after the measure of the length of the beard is the lack of sense and this is a wellknown thing among men of understanding' as saith one of the poets'ne'er was a man with beard grown overlong  tho' be he therefor reverenced and fear'dbut who the shortness noted in his wits  added to longness noted in his beard'and quoth another'i have a friend with a beard which god hath made to grow to a useless lengthit is like unto one of the nights of winter long and dark and cold'with this the broker took her and turned away with her and she asked whither goest thou with me he answered back to thy master the persian it sufficeth me what hath befallen me because of thee this day for thou hast been the means of spoiling both my trade and his by thine ill manners then she looked about the market right and left front and rear till by the decree of the decreer her eyes fell on ali nur aldin the cairene so she gazed at him and saw him to be a comely youth of straight slim form and smooth of face fourteen years old rare in beauty and loveliness and elegance and amorous grace like the full moon on the fourteenth night with forehead flowerwhite and cheeks rosy red neck like alabaster and teeth than jewels and dews of lips sweeter than sugar even as saith of him one of his describerscame to match him in beauty and loveliness rare  full moons and gazelles but quoth i 'soft farefare softly gazelles nor yourselves compare  with him and o moons all your pains forbear'and how well saith another bardslimwaisted loveling from his hair and brow  men wake amorn in night and light renewedblame not the mole that dwelleth on his cheek  for nu'uman's bloom aye shows spot negrohuedwhen the slavegirl beheld nur aldin he interposed between her and her wits she fell in love to him with a great and sudden fall and her heart was taken with affection for himand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventythird nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the slavegirl beheld nur aldin her heart was taken with affection for him so she turned to the broker and said to him will not yonder young merchant who is sitting among the traders in the gown of striped broadcloth bid somewhat more for me the broker replied o lady of fair ones yonder young man is a stranger from cairo where his father is chief of the traderguild and surpasseth all the merchants and notables of the place he is but lately come to this our city and lodgeth with one of his father's friends but he hath made no bid for thee nor more nor less when the girl heard the broker's words she drew from her finger a costly signetring of ruby and said to the man carry me to yonder youth and if he buy me this ring shall be thine in requital of thy travail with me this day the broker rejoiced at this and brought her up to nur aldin and she considered him straitly and found him like the full moon perfect in loveliness and a model of fine stature and symmetric grace even as saith of him one of his describerswaters of beauty o'er his cheeks flow bright  and rain his glances shafts that sorely smitechoked are his lovers an he deal disdain's  bitterest draught denaying lovedelighthis forehead and his stature and my love  are perfect perfected perfectiondighthis raiment folds enfold a lovely neck  as crescent moon in collar buttoned tighthis eyne and twinnd moles and tears of me  are night that nighteth to the nightliest nighthis eyebrows and his features and my frame  crescents on crescents are as crescents slighthis pupils pass the winecup to his friends  which albe sweet tastes bitter to my spriteand to my thirsty throat pure drink he dealt  from smiling lips what day we were unitethen is my blood to him my death to him  his right and rightful and most righteous rightthe girl gazed at nur aldin and said o my lord allah upon thee am i not beautiful and he replied o princess of fair ones is there in the world a comelier than thou she rejoined then why seest thou all the other merchants bid high for me and art silent nor sayest a word neither addest one dinar to my price 'twould seem i please thee not o my lord quoth he o my lady were i in my own land i had bought thee with all that my hand possesseth of monies and quoth she o my lord i said not 'buy me against thy will' yet didst thou but add somewhat to my price it would hearten my heart though thou buy me not so the merchants may say 'were not this girl handsome yonder merchant of cairo had not bidden for her for the cairenes are connoisseurs in slavegirls' these words abashed nur aldin and he blushed and said to the broker how high are the biddings for her he replied her price hath reached nine hundred and sixty dinars besides brokerage as for the sultan's dues they fall on the seller quoth nur aldin let me have her for a thousand dinars brokerage and price and the damsel hastening to the fore and leaving the broker said i sell myself to this handsome young man for a thousand dinars but nur aldin held his peace quoth one we sell to him and another he deserveth her and a third accursed son of accursed is he who biddeth and doth not buy and a fourth by allah they befit each other then before nur aldin could think the broker fetched kazis and witnesses who wrote out a contract of sale and purchase and the broker handed the paper to nur aldin saying take thy slavegirl and allah bless thee in her for she beseemeth none but thee and none but thou beseemeth her and he recited these two coupletsboom fortune sought him in humblest way  and came tohim draggletailed all astirand none is fittest for him but she  and none is fittest but hefor herhereat nur aldin was abashed before the merchants so he arose without stay or delay and weighed out the thousand dinars which he had left as a deposit with his father's friend the druggist and taking the girl carried her to the house wherein the shaykh had lodged him when she entered and saw nothing but ragged patched carpets and worn out rugs she said to him o my lord have i no value to thee and am i not worthy that thou shouldst bear me to thine own house and home wherein are thy goods that thou bringest me into thy servant's lodging why dost thou not carry me to thy father's dwelling he replied by allah o princess of fair ones this is my house wherein i dwell but it belongeth to an old man a druggist of this city who hath set it apart for me and lodged me therein i told thee that i was a stranger and that i am of the sons of cairo city she rejoined o my lord the least of houses sufficeth till thy return to thy native place but allah upon thee o my lord go now and fetch us somewhat of roast meat and wine and dried fruit and dessert quoth nur aldin by allah o princess of fair ones i had no money with me but the thousand dinars i paid down to thy price nor possess i any other good the few dirhams i owned were spent by me yesterday quoth she hast thou no friend in the town of whom thou mayst borrow fifty dirhams and bring them to me that i may tell thee what thou shalt do therewith and he said i have no intimate but the druggist then he betook himself forthright to the druggist and said to him peace be with thee o uncle he returned his salam and said to him o my son what hast thou bought for a thousand dinars this day nur aldin replied i have bought a slavegirl and the oldster rejoined o my son art thou mad that thou givest a thousand dinars for one slavegirl would i knew what kind of slavegirl she is said nur aldin she is a damsel of the children of the franksand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventyfourth nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that nur aldin said to the ancient druggist the damsel is of the children of the franks and the shaykh said o my son the best of the girls of the franks are to be had in this our town for an hundred dinars and by allah o my son they have cheated thee in the matter of this damsel however an thou have taken a fancy to her lie with her this night and do thy will of her and tomorrow morning go down with her to the market and sell her though thou lose by her two hundred dinars and reckon that thou hast lost them by shipwreck or hast been robbed of them on the road nur aldin replied right is thy rede o uncle but thou knowest that i had but the thousand dinars wherewith i purchased the damsel and now i have not a single dirham left to spend so i desire of thy favour and bounty that thou lend me fifty dirhams to provide me withal till tomorrow when i will sell her and repay thee out of her price said the old man willingly o my son and counted out to him the fifty dirhams then he said to him o my son thou art but young in years and the damsel is fair so belike thy heart will be taken with her and it will be grievous to thee to vend her now thou hast nothing to live on and these fifty dirhams will readily be spent and thou wilt come to me and i shall lend thee once and twice and thrice and so on up to ten times but an thou come to me after this i will not return thy salam and our friendship with thy father will end ill nur aldin took the fifty dirhams and returned with them to the damsel who said to him o my lord wend thee at once to the market and fetch me twenty dirhams' worth of stained silk of five colours and with the other thirty buy meat and bread and fruit and wine and flowers so he went to the market and purchasing for her all she sought brought it to her whereupon she rose and tucking up her sleeves cooked food after the most skilful fashion and set it before him he ate and she ate with him till they had enough after which she set on the wine and she drank and he drank and she ceased not to ply him with drink and entertain him with discourse till he became drunken and fell asleep thereupon she arose without stay or delay and taking out of her bundle a budget of tif leather opened it and drew forth a pair of knitting needles wherewith she fell to work and stinted not till she had made a beautiful zone which she folded up in a wrapper after cleaning it and ironing it and laid it under her pillow then she doffed her dress till she was mothernaked and lying down beside nur aldin shampoo'd him till he awoke from his heavy sleep he found by his side a maiden like virgin silver softer than silk and delicater than a tail of fatted sheep than standard more conspicuous and goodlier than the red camel in height five feet tall with breasts firm and full brows like bended bows eyes like gazelles' eyes and cheeks like bloodred anemones a slender waist with dimples laced and a navel holding an ounce of the unguent benzoin thighs like bolsters stuffed with ostrichdown and between them what the tongue fails to set forth and at mention whereof the tears jet forth brief it was as it were she to whom the poet alluded in these two coupletsfrom her hair is night from her forehead noon  from her sideface rose from her lip wine boonfrom her union heaven her severance hell  pearls from her teeth from her front full moonand how excellent is the saying of another barda moon she rises willowwand she waves  breathes ambergris and gazeth a gazellemeseems that sorrow wooes my heart and wins  and when she wends makes haste therein to dwellher face is fairer than the stars of wealth  and sheeny brows the crescent moon exceland quoth a third alsothey shine fullest moons unveil crescentbright  sway tenderest branches and turn wild kine'mid which is a darkeyed for love of whose charms  the sailors would joy to be ground lowli'enso nur aldin turned to her at once and clasping her to his bosom sucked first her upper lip and then her under lip and slid his tongue between the twain into her mouth then he rose to her and found her a pearl unthridden and a filly none but he had ridden so he abated her maidenhead and had of her amorous delight and there was knitted between them a lovebond which might never know breach nor severance he rained upon her cheeks kisses like the falling of pebbles into water and struck with stroke upon stroke like the thrusting of spears in battle brunt for that nur aldin still yearned after clipping of necks and sucking of lips and letting down of tress and pressing of waist and biting of cheek and cavalcading on breast with cairene buckings and yamani wrigglings and abyssinian sobbings and hind pamoisons and nubian lasciviousness and rf legliftings and damiettan moanings and sa'd hotness and alexandrian languishment and this damsel united in herself all these virtues together with excess of beauty and loveliness and indeed she was even as saith of her the poetthis is she i will never forget till i die  nor draw near but to those who to her draw nigha being for semblance like moon at full  praise her maker her modeller glorifytho' be sore my sin seeking loveliesse  on esperanceday ne'er repent can ia couplet reciting which none can know  save the youth who in couplets and rhymes shall cry'none weeteth love but who bears its load  nor passion save pleasures and pains he aby'so nur aldin lay with the damsel through the night in solace and delightand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventyfifth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nur aldin lay with that damsel through the night in solace and delight the twain garbed in the closely buttoned garments of embrace safe and secure against the misways of nights and days and they passed the dark hours after the goodliest fashion fearing naught in their joys lovefraught from excess of talk and prate as saith of them the right excellent poetgo visit her thou lovest and regard notthe words detractors utter envious churlscan never favour love oh sure the mercifulne'er make a thing more fair to look uponthan two fond lovers in each other's armsspeaking their passion in a mute embracewhen heart has turned to heart the fools would part themstrike idly on cold steel so when thou'st foundone purely wholly thine accept her true heartand live for her alone oh thou that blamestthe lovestruck for their love give o'er thy talkhow canst thou minister to a mind diseasedwhen the morning morrowed in sheen and shone nur aldin awoke from deep sleep and found that she had brought water so they made the ghuslablution he and she and he performed that which behoved him of prayer to his lord after which she set before him meat and drink and he ate and drank then the damsel put her hand under her pillow and pulling out the girdle which she had knitted during the night gave it to nur aldin who asked whence cometh this girdle answered she o my lord 'tis the silk thou boughtest yesterday for twenty dirhams rise now and go to the persian bazar and give it to the broker to cry for sale and sell it not for less than twenty gold pieces in ready money quoth nur aldin o princess of fair ones how can a thing that cost twenty dirhams and will sell for as many dinars be made in a single night and quoth she o my lord thou knowest not the value of this thing but go to the market therewith and give it to the broker and when he shall cry it its worth will be made manifest to thee herewith he carried the zone to the market and gave it to the broker bidding him cry it whilst he himself sat down on a masonry bench before a shop the broker fared forth and returning after a while said to him o my lord rise take the price of thy zone for it hath fetched twenty dinars money down when nur aldin heard this he marvelled with exceeding marvel and shook with delight then he rose between belief and misbelief to take the money and when he had received it he went forthright and spent it all on silk of various colours and returning home gave his purchase to the damsel saying make this all into girdles and teach me likewise how to make them that i may work with thee for never in the length of my life saw i a fairer craft than this craft nor a more abounding in gain and profit by allah 'tis better than the trade of a merchant a thousand times she laughed at his language and said o my lord go to thy friend the druggist and borrow other thirty dirhams of him and tomorrow repay him from the price of the girdle the thirty together with the fifty already loaned to thee so he rose and repaired to the druggist and said to him o uncle lend me other thirty dirhams and tomorrow almighty allah willing i will repay thee the whole fourscore the old man weighed him out thirty dirhams wherewith he went to the market and buying meat and bread dried fruits and flowers as before carried them home to the damsel whose name was miriam the girdlegirl she rose forthright and making ready rich meats set them before her lord nur aldin after which she brought the wineservice and they drank and plied each other with drink when the wine began to play with their wits his pleasant address and inner grace pleased her and she recited these two coupletssaid i to slimwaist who the wine engraced  brought in muskscented bowl and a superfine'was it prest from thy cheek' he replied 'nay nay  when did man from roses e'er press the wine'and the damsel ceased not to carouse with her lord and ply him with cup and bowl and require him to fill for her and give her to drink of that which sweeteneth the spirits and whenever he put forth hand to her she drew back from him out of coquetry the wine added to her beauty and loveliness and nur aldin recited these two coupletsslimwaist craved wine from her companeer  cried in meeting of friends when he feared for his fere'an thou pass not the wine thou shalt pass the night  abanisht my bed' and he felt sore fearthey ceased not drinking till drunkenness overpowered nur aldin and he slept whereupon she rose forthright and fell to work upon a zone as was her wont when she had wrought it to end she wrapped it in paper and doffing her clothes lay down by his side and enjoyed dalliance and delight till morn appearedand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventysixth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that miriam the girdlegirl having finished her zone and wrapped it in paper doffed her dress and lay down by the side of her lord and then happened to them what happened of dalliance and delight and he did his devoir like a man on the morrow she gave him the girdle and said to him carry this to the market and sell it for twenty dinars even as thou soldest its fellow yesterday so he went to the bazar and sold the girdle for twenty dinars after which he repaired to the druggist and paid him back the eighty dirhams thanking him for the bounties and calling down blessings upon him he asked o my son hast thou sold the damsel and nur aldin answered wouldst thou have me sell the soul out of my body and he told him all that had passed from commencement to conclusion whereat the druggist joyed with joy galore than which could be no more and said to him by allah o my son thou gladdenest me inshallah mayst thou ever be in prosperity indeed i wish thee well by reason of my affection for thy ather and the continuance of my friendship with him then nur aldin left the shaykh and straightway going to the market bought meat and fruit and wine and all that he needed according to his custom and returned therewith to miriam they abode thus a whole year in eating and drinking and mirth and merriment and love and good comradeship and every night she made a zone and he sold it on the morrow for twenty dinars wherewith he bought their needs and gave the rest to her to keep against a time of necessity after the twelvemonth she said to him one day o my lord whenas thou sellest the girdle tomorrow buy for me with its price silk of six colours because i am minded to make thee a kerchief to wear on thy shoulders such as never son of merchant no nor king's son ever rejoiced in its like so next day he fared forth to the bazar and after selling the zone brought her the dyed silks she sought and miriam the girdlegirl wrought at the kerchief a whole week for every night when she had made an end of the zone she would work awhile at the kerchief till it was finished then she gave it to nur aldin who put it on his shoulders and went out to walk in the marketplace whilst all the merchants and folk and notables of the town crowded about him to gaze on his beauty and that of the kerchief which was of the most beautiful now it chanced that one night after this he awoke from sleep and found miriam weeping passing sore and reciting these coupletsnears my parting fro' my love nigher draws the severanceday  ah wellaway for parting and again ah wellawayand in tway is torn my heart and o pine i'm doomed to bear  for the nights that erst witnessed our pleasurable playno help for it but envier the twain of us espy  with evil eye and win to us his lamentable wayfor naught to us is sorer than the jealousy of men  and the backbiter's eyne that with calumny affrayhe said o my lady miriam what aileth thee to weep and she replied i weep for the anguish of parting for my heart presageth me thereof quoth he o lady of fair ones and who shall interpose between us seeing that i love thee above all creatures and tender thee the most and quoth she and i love thee twice as well as thou me but fair opinion of fortune still garreth folk fall into affliction and right well saith the poet'think'st thou thyself all prosperous in days which prosp'rous benor fearest thou impending ill which comes by heaven's decreewe see the orbs of heav'n above how numberless they arebut sun and moon alone eclips'd and ne'er a lesser starand many a tree on earth we see some bare some leafy greenof them not one is hurt with stone save that has fruitful beensee'st not th' refluent ocean bear carrion on its tidewhile pearls beneath its wavy flow fixed in the deep abide'presently she added o my lord nur aldin an thou desire to nonsuit separation be on thy guard against a swartvisaged oldster blind of the right eye and lame of the left leg for he it is who will be the cause of our severance i saw him enter the city and i opine that he is come hither in quest of me replied nur aldin o lady of fair ones if my eyes light on him i will slay him and make an example of him rejoined she o my lord slay him not but talk not nor trade with him neither buy nor sell with him nor sit nor walk with him nor speak one word to him no not even the answer prescribed by law and i pray allah to preserve us from his craft and his mischief next morning nur aldin took the zone and carried it to the market where he sat down on a shopbench and talked with the sons of the merchants till the drowsiness preceding slumber overcame him and he lay down on the bench and fell asleep presently behold up came the frank whom the damsel had described to him in company with seven others and seeing nur aldin lying asleep on the bench with his head wrapped in the kerchief which miriam had made for him and the edge thereof in his grasp sat down by him and hent the end of the kerchief in hand and examined it turning it over for some time nur aldin sensed that there was something and awoke then seeing the very man of whom miriam had warned him sitting by his side cried out at him with a great cry which startled him quoth the frank what aileth thee to cry out thus at us have we taken from thee aught and quoth nur aldin by allah o accursed haddest thou taken aught from me i would carry thee before the chief of police then said the frank o moslem i conjure thee by thy faith and by that wherein thou believest inform me whence thou haddest this kerchief and nur aldin replied tis the handiwork of my lady motherand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventyseventh nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the frank asked nur aldin anent the maker of the kerchief he answered saying in very sooth this kerchief is the handiwork of my mother who made it for me with her own hand quoth the frank wilt thou sell it to me and take ready money for it and quoth nur aldin by allah i will not sell it to thee or to any else for she made none other than it sell it to me and i will give thee to its price this very moment five hundred dinars money down and let her who made it make thee another and a finer i will not sell it at all for there is not the like of it in this city o my lord wilt thou sell it for six hundred ducats of fine gold and the frank went on to add to his offer hundred by hundred till he bid nine hundred dinars but nur aldin said allah will open to me otherwise than by my vending it i will never sell it not for two thousand dinars nor more than that no never the frank ceased not to tempt him with money till he bid him a thousand dinars and the merchants present said we sell thee the kerchief at that price pay down the money quoth nur aldin i will not sell it i swear by allah but one of the merchants said to him know thou o my son that the value of this kerchief is an hundred dinars at most and that to an eager purchaser and if this frank pay thee down a thousand for it thy profit will be nine hundred dinars and what gain canst thou desire greater than this gain wherefore 'tis my rede that thou sell him this kerchief at that price and bid her who wrought it make thee other finer than it so shalt thou profit nine hundred dinars by this accursed frank the enemy of allah and of the faith nur aldin was abashed at the merchants and sold the kerchief to the frank who in their presence paid him down the thousand dinars with which he would have returned to his handmaid to congratulate her on what had passed but the stranger said harkye o company of merchants stop my lord nur aldin for you and he are my guests this night i have a jar of old greek wine and a fat lamb fresh fruit flowers and confections wherefore do ye all cheer me with your company tonight and not one of you tarry behind so the merchants said o my lord nur aldin we desire that thou be with us on the like of this night so we may talk together we and thou and we pray thee of thy favour and bounty to bear us company so we and thou may be the guests of this frank for he is a liberal man and they conjured him by the oath of divorce and hindered him by main force from going home then they rose forthright and shutting up their shops took nur aldin and fared with the frank who brought them to a goodly and spacious saloon wherein were two dases here he made them sit and set before them a scarlet traycloth of goodly workmanship and unique handiwork wroughten in gold with figures of breaker and broken lover and beloved asker and asked whereon he ranged precious vessels of porcelain and crystal full of the costliest confections fruits and flowers and brought them a flagon of old greek wine then he bade slaughter a fat lamb and kindling fire proceeded to roast of its flesh and feed the merchants therewith and give them draughts of that wine winking at them the while to ply nur aldin with drink accordingly they ceased not plying him with wine till he became drunken and took leave of his wits so when the frank saw that he was drowned in liquor he said to him o my lord nur aldin thou gladdenest us with thy company tonight welcome and again welcome to thee then he engaged him awhile in talk till he could draw near to him when he said with dissembling speech o my lord nur aldin wilt thou sell me thy slavegirl whom thou boughtest in presence of these merchants a year ago for a thousand dinars i will give thee at this moment five thousand gold pieces for her and thou wilt thus make four thousand ducats profit nur aldin refused but the frank ceased not to ply him with meat and drink and lure him with lucre still adding to his offers till he bid him ten thousand dinars for her whereupon nur aldin in his drunkenness said before the merchants i sell her to thee for ten thousand dinars hand over the money at this the frank rejoiced with joy exceeding and took the merchants to witness the sale they passed the night in eating and drinking mirth and merriment till the morning when the frank cried out to his pages saying bring me the money so they brought it to him and he counted out ten thousand dinars to nur aldin saying o my lord take the price of thy slavegirl whom thou soldest to me last night in the presence of these moslem merchants replied nur aldin o accursed i sold thee nothing and thou liest anent me for i have no slavegirls quoth the frank in very sooth thou didst sell her to me and these merchants were witnesses to the bargain thereupon all said yes indeed thou soldest him thy slavegirl before us for ten thousand dinars o nur aldin and we will all bear witness against thee of the sale come take the money and deliver him the girl and allah will give thee a better than she in her stead doth it irk thee o nur aldin that thou boughtest the girl for a thousand dinars and hast enjoyed for a year and a half her beauty and loveliness and taken thy fill of her converse and her favours furthermore thou hast gained some ten thousand golden dinars by the sale of the zones which she made thee every day and thou soldest for twenty sequins and after all this thou hast sold her again at a profit of nine thousand dinars over and above her original price and withal thou deniest the sale and belittlest and makest difficulties about the profit what gain is greater than this gain and what profit wouldst thou have profitabler than this profit an thou love her thou hast had thy fill of her all this time so take the money and buy thee another handsomer than she at a dowry of less than half this price and the rest of the money will remain in thy hand as capital and the merchants ceased not to ply him with persuasion and special arguments till he took the ten thousand dinars the price of the damsel and the frank straightway fetched kazis and witnesses who drew up the contract of sale by nur aldin of the handmaid hight miriam the girdlegirl such was his case but as regards the damsel's she sat awaiting her lord from morning till sundown and from sundown till the noon of night and when he returned not she was troubled and wept with sore weeping the old druggist heard her sobbing and sent his wife who went in to her and finding her in tears said to her o my lady what aileth her and finding her in tears said to her o my lady what aileth thee to weep said she o my mother i have sat waiting the return of my lord nur aldin all day but he cometh not and i fear lest some one have played a trick on him to make him sell me and he have fallen into the snare and sold meand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventyeighth nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that miriam the girdlegirl said to the druggist's wife i am fearful lest some one have been playing a trick on my lord to make him sell me and he have fallen into the snare and sold me said the other o my lady miriam were they to give thy lord this hall full of gold as thy price yet would he not sell thee for what i know of his love to thee but o my lady belike there be a company come from his parents at cairo and he hath made them an entertainment in the lodging where they alighted being ashamed to bring them hither for that the place is not spacious enough for them or because their condition is less than that he should bring them to his own house or belike he preferred to conceal thine affair from them so passed the night with them and inshallah tomorrow he will come to thee safe and sound so burden not thy soul with cark and care o my lady for of a certainty this is the cause of his absence from thee last night and i will abide with thee this coming night and comfort thee until thy lord return to thee so the druggist's wife abode with her and cheered her with talk throughout the dark hours and when it was morning miriam saw her lord enter the street followed by the frank and amiddlemost a company of merchants at which sight her sidemuscles quivered and her colour changed and she fell ashaking as ship shaketh in midocean for the violence of the gale when the druggist's wife saw this she said to her o my lady miriam what aileth thee that i see thy case changed and thy face grown pale and show disfeatured replied she by allah o my lady my heart forebodeth me of parting and severance of union and she bemoaned herself with the saddest sighs reciting these coupletsincline not to parting i pray  for bitter its savour is ayee'en the sun at his setting turns pale  to think he must part from the dayand so at his rising for joy  of reunion he's radiant and gaythen miriam wept passing sore wherethan naught could be more making sure of separation and cried to the druggist's wife o my mother said i not to thee that my lord nur aldin had been tricked into selling me i doubt not but he hath sold me this night to yonder frank albeit i bade him beware of him but deliberation availeth not against destiny so the truth of my words is made manifest to thee whilst they were talking behold in came nur aldin and the damsel looked at him and saw that his colour was changed and that he trembled and there appeared on his face signs of grief and repentance so she said to him o my lord nur aldin meseemeth thou hast sold me whereupon he wept with sore weeping and groaned and lamented and recited these coupletswhen e'er the lord 'gainst any manwould fulminate some harsh decreeand he be wise and skilled to hearand used to seehe stops his ears and blinds his heartand from his brain ill judgment tearsand makes it bald as 'twere a scalpreft of its hairsuntil the time when the whole manbe pierced by this divine commandthen he restores him intellectto understandthen nur aldin began to excuse himself to his handmaid saying by allah o my lady miriam verily runneth the reed with whatso allah hath decreed the folk put a cheat on me to make me sell thee and i fell into the snare and sold thee indeed i have sorely failed of my duty to thee but haply he who decreed our disunion will vouchsafe us reunion quoth she i warned thee against this for this it was i dreaded then she strained him to her bosom and kissed him between the eyes reciting these coupletsnow by your love your love i'll ne'er forget  though lost my life for stress of pine and freti weep and wail through livelong day and night  as moans the dove on sandhilltree beseto fairest friends your absence spoils my life  nor find i meetingplace as erst we metat this juncture behold the frank came in to them and went up to miriam to kiss her hands but she dealt him a buffet with her palm on the cheek saying avaunt o accursed thou hast followed after me without surcease till thou hast cozened my lord into selling me but o accursed all shall yet be well inshallah the frank laughed at her speech and wondered at her deed and excused himself to her saying o my lady mirian what is my offence thy lord nur aldin here sold thee of his full consent and of his own free will had he loved thee by the right of the messiah he had not transgressed against thee and had he not fulfilled his desire of thee he had not sold thee quoth one of the poets'whom i irk let him fly fro' me fast and faster  if i name hisname i am no directernor the wide wide world is to me so narrow  that i act expecterto this rejecter'now this handmaid was the daughter of the king of france the which is a wide an spacious city abounding in manufactures and rarities and trees and flowers and other growths and resembleth the city of constantinople and for her going forth of her father's city there was a wondrous cause and thereby hangeth a marvellous tale which we will set out in due order to divert and delight the hearerand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and seventyninth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the cause of miriam the girdlegirl leaving her father and mother was a wondrous and thereby hangeth a marvellous tale she was reared with her father and mother in honour and indulgence and learnt rhetoric and penmanship and arithmetic and cavalarice and all manner crafts such as broidery and sewing and weaving and girdlemaking and silkcord making and damascening gold on silver and silver on gold brief all the arts both of men and women till she became the unionpearl of her time and the unique gem of her age and day moreover allah to whom belong might and majesty had endowed her with such beauty and loveliness and elegance and perfection of grace that she excelled therein all the folk of her time and the kings of the isles sought her in marriage of her sire but he refused to give her to wife to any of her suitors for that he loved her with passing love and could not bear to be parted from her a single hour moreover he had no other daughter than herself albeit he had many sons but she was dearer to him than all of them it fortuned one year that she fell sick of an exceeding sickness and came nigh upon death werefore she made a vow that if she recovered from her malady she would make the pilgrimage to a certain monastery situate in such an island which was high in repute among the franks who used to make vows to it and look for a blessing therefrom when miriam recovered from her sickness she wished to accomplish her vow anent the monastery and her sire despatched her to the convent in a little ship with sundry daughters of the citynotables to wait upon her and patrician knights to protect them all as they drew near the island there came out upon them a ship of the ships of the moslems champions of the faith warring in allah's way who boarded the vessel and making prize of all therein knights and maidens gifts and monies sold their booty in the city of kayrawn miriam herself fell into the hands of a persian merchant who was born impotent and for whom no woman had ever discovered her nakedness so he set her to serve him presently he fell ill and sickened well nigh unto death and the sickness abode with him two months during which she tended him after the goodliest fashion till allah made him whole of his malady when he recalled her tenderness and lovingkindness to him and the persistent zeal with which she had nurst him and being minded to requite her the good offices she had done him said to her ask a boon of me she said o my lord i ask of thee that thou sell me not but to the man of my choice he answered so be it i guarantee thee by allah o miriam i will not sell thee but to him of whom thou shalt approve and i put thy sale in thine own hand and she rejoiced herein with joy exceeding now the persian had expounded to her alislam and she became a moslemah and learnt of him the rules of worship furthermore during that period the perisan had taught her the tenets of the faith and the observances incumbent upon her he had made her learn the koran by heart and master somewhat of the theological sciences and the traditions of the prophet after which he brought her to alexandriacity and sold her to nur aldin as we have before set out meanwhile when her father the king of france heard what had befallen his daughter and her company he saw doomsday break and sent after her ships full of knights and champions horsemen and footsmen but they fell not in any trace of her whom they sought in the islands of the moslems so all returned to him crying out and saying wellaway and ruin and well worth the day the king grieved for her with exceeding grief and sent after her that oneeyed lameter blind of the left for that he was his chief wazir a stubborn tyrant and a froward devil full of craft and guile bidding him make search for her in all the lands of the moslems and buy her though with a shipload of gold so the accursed sought her in all the islands of the arabs and all the cities of the moslems but found no sign of her till he came to alexandriacity where he made quest for her and presently discovered that she was with nur aldin ali the cairene being directed to the trace of her by the kerchief aforesaid for that none could have wrought it in such goodly guise but she then he bribed the merchants to help him in getting her from nur aldin and beguiled her lord into selling her as hath been already related when he had her in his possession she ceased not to weep and wail so he said to her o my lady miriam put away from thee this mourning and grieving and return with me to the city of thy sire the seat of thy kingship and the place of thy power and thy home so thou mayst be among thy servants and attendants and be quit of this abasement and this strangerhood enough hath betided me of travail of travel and of disbursing monies on thine account for thy father bade me buy thee back though with a shipload of gold and now i have spent nigh a year and a half in seeking thee and he fell to kissing her hands and feet and humbling himself to her but the more he kissed and grovelled she only redoubled in wrath against him and said to him o accursed may almighty allah not vouchsafe thee to win thy wish presently his pages brought her a shemule with goldembroidered housings and mounting her thereon raised over her head a silken canopy with staves of gold and silver and the franks walked round about her till they brought her forth the city by the seagate where they took boat with her and rowing out to a great ship in harbor embarked therein then the monocular wazir cried out to the sailors saying up with the mast so they set it up forthright and spreading the newly bent sails and the colours manned the sweeps and put out to sea meanwhile miriam continued to gaze upon alexandria till it disappeared from her eyes when she fell aweeping in her privacy with sore weepingand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and eightieth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the wazir of the frankish king put out to sea in the ship bearing miriam the girdlegirl she gazed alexandriawards till the city was hidden from her sight when she wailed and wept copious tears and recited these coupletso dwelling of my friends say is there no return  uswards but what ken i of matters allah madestill fare the ships of severance sailing hastily  and in my wounded eyelids tear have ta'en their steadfor parting from a friend who was my wish and will  healed every ill and every pain and pang allay'dbe thou o allah substitute of me for him  such charge some day the care of thee shall not evadethen she could not refrain from weeping and wailing so the patrician knights came up to her and would have comforted her but she heeded not their consoling words being distracted by the claims of passion and lovelonging and she shed tears and moaned and complained and recited these coupletsthe tongue of love within my vitals speaketh  saying 'this lover boon of love aye seeketh'and burn my liver hottest coals of passion  and parting on my heart sore suffering wreakethhow shall i face this fiery love concealing  when fro' my wounded lids the tear aye leakethin this plight miriam abode during all the voyage no peace was left her at all nor would patience come at her call such was her case in company with the wazir the monocular the lameter but as regards nur aldin the cairene when the ship had sailed with miriam the world was straitened upon him and he had neither peace nor patience he returned to the lodging where they twain had dwelt and its aspect was black and gloomy in his sight then he saw the mtier wherewith she had been wont to make the zones and her dress that had been upon her beauteous body so he pressed them to his breast whilst the tears gushed from his eyes and he recited these coupletssay me will union after parting e'er return to be  after longlasting torments after hopeless miseryalas alas what wont to be shall never more return  but grant me still return of dearest her these eyne may seei wonder me will allah deign our parted lives unite  and will my dear one's plighted

lord of threefold worlds i pray he deign to me return  my lover and we meet as wont in joy and jubileethen nur aldin wept with weeping galore than which naught could be more and peering into ever corner of the room recited these two coupletsi view their traces and with pain i pine  and by their sometime home i weep and yearnand him i pray who parting deigned decree  some day he deign vouchsafe me their returnthen nur aldin sprang to his feet and locking the door of the house fared forth running at speed to the sea shore whence he fixed his eyes on the place of the ship which had carried off his miriam whilst sighs burst from his breast and tears from his lids as he recited these coupletspeace be with you sans you naught compensateth me  the near the far two cases only here i seei yearn for you at every hour and tide as yearns  for waterplace wayfarer plodding wearilywith you abide my hearing heart and eyensight  and sweeter than the honeycomb your memorythen o my grief when fared

weeping and crying out o miriam o miriam behold an old man landed from a vessel and coming up to him saw him shedding tears and heard him reciting these verseso maryam of beauty return for these eyne  are as densest clouds railing drops in lineask amid mankind and my railers shall say  that mine eyelids are drowning these eyeballs of minesaid the old man o my son meseems thou weepest for the damsel who sailed yesterday with the frank when nur aldin heard these words of the shaykh he fell down in a swoon and lay for a long while without life then coming to himself he wept with sore weeping and improvised these coupletsshall we e'er be unite after severancetide  and return in the perfectest cheer to bidein my heart indeed is a lowe of love  and i'm pained by the spies who my pain deridemy

criedthe old man looked at him and noting his beauty and grace and symmetry and the fluency of his tongue and the seductiveness of his charms had ruth on him and his heart mourned for his case now that shaykh was the captain of a ship bound to the damsel's city and in this ship were a hundred moslem merchants men of the saving faith so he said to nur aldin have patience and all will yet be well i will bring thee to her an it be the will of allah extolled and exalted be heand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and eightyfirst nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the old skipper said to nur aldin i will bring thee to her inshallah the youth asked when shall we set out and the other said come but three days more and we will depart in peace and prosperity nur aldin rejoiced at the captain's words with joy exceeding and thanked him for his bounty and benevolence then he recalled the days of loveliesse dear and union with his slavegirl without peer and he shed bitter tears and recited these coupletssay will to me and you the ruthful union show  my lords shall e'er i win the wish of me or noa visitboon by you will shifty time vouchsafe  and seize your image eyelids which so hungry growwith you were union to be sold i fain would buy  but ah i see such grace doth all my means outgothen nur aldin went forthright to the market and bought what he needed of viaticum and other necessaries for the voyage and returned to the rais who said to him o my son what is that thou hast with thee said he my provisions and all whereof i have need for the voyage thereupon quoth the old man laughing o my son art thou going apleasuring to pompey's pillar verily between thee and that thou seekest is two months' journey and the wind be fair and the weather favourable then he took of him somewhat of money and going to the bazar bought him a sufficiency of all that he needed for the voyage and filled him a large earthen jar with fresh water nur aldin abode in the ship three days until the merchants had made an end of their precautions and preparations and embarked when they set sail and putting out to sea fared on oneandfifty days after this there came out upon them corsairs pirates who sacked the ship and taking nur aldin and all therein prisoners carried them to the city of france and paraded them before the king who bade cast them into jail nur aldin amongst the number as they were being led to prison the galleon arrived with the princess miriam and the oneeyed wazir and when it made the harbour the lameter landed and going up to the king gave him the glad news of his daughter's safe return whereupon they beat the kettledrums for good tidings and decorated the city after the goodliest fashion then the king took horse with all his guards and lords and notables and rode down to the sea to meet her the moment the ship cast anchor she came ashore and the king saluted her and embraced her and mounting her on a bloodsteed bore her to the palace where her mother received her with open arms and asked her of her case and whether she was a maid as before or whether she had become a woman carnally known by man she replied o my mother how should a girl who hath been sold from merchant to merchant in the land of moslems a slave commanded abide a virgin the merchant who bought me threatened me with the bastinado and violenced me and took my maidenhead after which he sold me to another and he again to a third when the queen heard these her words the light in her eyes became night and she repeated her confession to the king who was chagrined thereat and his affair was grievous to him so he expounded her case to his grandees and patricians who said to him o king she hath been defiled by the moslems and naught will purify her save the striking off of an hundred mohammedan heads whereupon the king sent for the true believers he had imprisoned and they decapitated them one after another beginning with the captain till none was left save nur aldin they tare off a strip of his skirt and binding his eyes therewith led him to the rug of blood and were about to smite his neck when behold an ancient dame came up to the king at that very moment and said o my lord thou didst vow to bestow upon each and every church five moslem captives to held us in the service thereof so allah would restore thee thy daughter the princess miriam and now she is restored to thee so do thou fulfil thy vow the king replied o my mother by the virtue of the messiah and the veritable faith there remaineth to me of the prisoners but this one captive whom they are about to put to death so take him with thee to help in the service of the church till there come to me more prisoners of the moslems when i will send thee other four hadst thou come earlier before they hewed off the heads of these i had given thee as many as thou wouldest have the old woman thanked the king for his boon and wished him continuance of life glory and prosperity then without loss of time she went up to nur aldin whom she raised from the rug of blood and looking narrowly at him saw a comely youth and a dainty with a delicate skin and a face like the moon at her full whereupon she carried him to the church and said to him o my son doff these clothes which are upon thee for they are fit only for the service of the sultan so saying the ancient dame brought him a gown and hood of black wool and a broad girdle in which she clad and cowled him and after binding on his belt bade him do the service of the church accordingly he served the church seven days at the end of which time behold the old woman came up to him and said o moslem don thy silken dress and take these ten dirhams and go out forthright and divert thyself abroad this day and tarry not here a single moment lest thou lose thy life quoth he what is to do o my mother and quoth she know o my son that the king's daughter the princess miriam the girdlegirl hath a mind to visit the church this day to seek a blessing by pilgrimage and to make oblation thereto a douceur of thankoffering for her deliverance from the land of the moslems and in fulfilment of the vows she vowed to the messiah so he would save her with her are four hundred damsels not one of whom but is perfect in beauty and loveliness and all of them are daughters of wazirs and emirs and grandees they will be here during this very hour and if their eyes fall on thee in this church they will hew thee in pieces with swords thereupon nur aldin took the ten dirhams from the ancient dame and donning his own dress went out to the bazar and walked about the city and took his pleasure therein till he knew its highways and gatesand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and eightysecond nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that nur aldin after donning his own dress and taking the ten dirhams from the ancient dame fared forth to the market streets and wandered about a while till he knew every quarter of the city after which he returned to the church and saw the princess miriam the girdlegirl daughter of the king of france come up to the fane attended by four hundred damsels highbosomed maids like moons amongst whom was the daughter of the oneeyed wazir and those of the emirs and lords of the realm and she walked in their midst as she were moon among stars when his eyes fell upon her nur aldin could not contain himself but cried out from the core of his heart o miriam o miriam when the damsels heard his outcry they ran at him with swords shining bright like flashes of levenlight and would have slain him forthright but the princess turned and looking on him knew him with fullest knowledge and said to her maidens leave this youth doubtless he is mad for the signs of madness be manifest on his face when nur aldin heard this he uncovered his head and rolled his eyes and made signs with his hands and twisted his legs foaming the while at the mouth quoth the princess said i not that the poor youth was mad bring him to me and stand off from him that i may hear what he saith for i know the speech of the arabs and will look into his case and see if his madness admit of cure or not so they laid hold of him and brought him to her after which they withdrew to a distance and she said to him hast thou come hither on my account and ventured thy life for my sake and feignest thyself mad he replied o my lady hast thou not heard the saying of the poet'quoth they 'thou'rt surely raving mad for her thou lov'st' and i 'there is no pleasantness in life but for the mad' replycompare my madness with herself for whom i rave if she accord therewith then blame me not for that which i aby'miriam replied by allah o nur aldin indeed thou hast sinned against thyself for i warned thee of this before it befell thee yet wouldst thou not hearken to me but followest thine own lust albeit that whereof i gave thee to know i learnt not by means of inspiration nor physiognomy nor dreams but by eyewitness and very sight for i saw the oneeyed wazir and knew that he was not come to alexandria but in quest of me said he o my lady miriam we seek refuge with allah from the error of the intelligent then his affliction redoubled on him and he recited this sayingpass o'er my fault for 'tis the wise man's wontof other's sins to take no harsh accountand as all crimes have made my breast their siteso thine all shapes of mercy should unitewho from above would mercy seek to knowshould first be merciful to those belowthen nur aldin and princess miriam ceased not from lovers' chiding which to trace would be tedious relating each to other that which had befallen them and reciting verses and making moan one to other of the violence of passion and the pangs of pine and desire whilst the tears ran down their cheeks like rivers till there was left them no strength to say a word and so they continued till day deprated and night darkened now the princess was clad in a green dress purfled with red gold and broidered with pearls and gems which enhanced her beauty and loveliness and inner grace and right well quoth the poet of herlike the full moon she shineth in garments all of green with loosened vest and collars and flowing hair beseen'what is thy name' i asked her and she replied 'i'm she who roasts the hearts of lovers on coals of love and teeni am the pure white silver ay and the gold wherewith the bondsmen from strait prison and dour releasd been'quoth i 'i'm all with rigours consumed' but 'on a rock' said she 'such as my heart is thy plaints are wasted clean''even if thy heart' i answered 'be rock in very deed yet hath god caused fair water well from the rock i ween'and when night darkened on them the lady miriam went up to her women and asked them have ye locked the door and they answered indeed we have locked it so she took them and went with them to a place called the hapel of the lady mary the virgin mother of light because the nazarenes hold that there are her heart and soul the girls betook themselves to prayer for blessings from above and circuited all the church and when they had made an end of their visitation the princess turned to them and said i desire to pass the night alone in the virgin's chapel and seek a blessing thereof for that yearning after it hath betided me by reason of my long absence in the land of the moslems and as for you when ye have made an end of your visitation do ye sleep whereso ye will replied they with love and goodly gree be it as thou wilt and leaving her alone in the chapel dispersed about the church and slept the lady miriam waited till they were out of sight and hearing then went in search of nur aldin whom she found sitting in a corner on live coals awaiting her he rose and kissed her hands and feet and she sat down and seated him by her side then she pulled off all that was upon her of raiment and ornaments and fine linen and taking nur aldin in her arms strained him to her bosom and they ceased not she and he from kissing and clipping and strumming to the tune of hocuspocus saying the while how short are the nights of union and the nights of disunion how long are they and reciting these verseso night of union time's virginal prized  white star of the nights with auroral dyesthou garrest dawn after noon to rise  say art thou kohl in morning's eyesor wast thou slumber to bleared eye liefo night of parting how long thy stay  whose latest hours aye the first portraythis endless circle that noways may  show breach till the coming of judgmentdayday when dies the lover of partinggriefas they were in this mighty delight and joy engrossing they heard one of the servants of the saint smite the gong upon the roof to call the folk to the rites of their worship and he was even as saith the poeti saw him strike the gong and asked of him straightway  who made the fawn at striking going so knowing eh'and to my soul 'what smiting irketh thee the more  striking the gong or striking note of going say'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and eightythird nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nur aldin and miriam the girdlegirl rose forthwith and donned her clothes and ornaments but this was grievous to nur aldin and his gladness was troubled the tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these coupletsi ceasd not to kiss that cheek with budding roses dight  and eyes down cast and bit the same with most emphatic biteuntil we were in gloria and lay him down the spy  and sank his eyes within his brain declining further sightand struck the gongs as they that had the charge of them were like  muezzin crying dutyprayers in allah's book inditethen rose she up right hastily and donned the dress she'd doffed  sore fearing lest a shootingstar upon our heads alightand cried 'o wish and will of me o end of all my hopes  behold the morning comes to us in brightest whitest light'i swear if but one day of rule were given to my life  and i were made an emperor of majesty and mightadown i'd break the buttresses of churches one and all  and by their slaughter rid the earth of every shaveling wightthen the lady miriam pressed him to her bosom and kissed his cheek and asked him o nur aldin how long hast thou been in this town seven days hast thou walked about in it and dost thou know its ways and issues and its seagates and land gates yes knowest thou the way to the offertorychest of the church yes since thou knowest all this as soon as the first third of the coming night is over go to the offertorychest and take thence what thou wishest and willest then open the door that giveth upon the tunnel leading to the sea and go down to the harbour where thou wilt find a little ship and ten men therein and when the rais shall see thee he will put out his hand to thee give him thy hand and he will take thee up into the ship and do thou wait there till i come to thee but 'ware and have a care lest sleep overtake thee this night or thou wilt repent whenas repentance shall avail thee naught then the princess farewelled him and going forth from nur aldin aroused from sleep her women and the rest of the damsels with whom she betook herself to the church door and knocked whereupon the ancient dame opened to her and she went forth and found the knights and varlets standing without they brought her a dapple shemule and she mounted whereupon they raised over her head a canopy with curtains of silk and the knights took hold of the mule's halter then the guards encompassed her about drawn brand in hand and fared on with her followed by her till they brought her to the palace of the king her father meanwhile nur aldin abode concealed behind the curtain under cover of which miriam and he had passed the night till it was broad day when the main door was opened and the church became full of people then he mingled with the folk and accosted the old prioress the guardian of the shrine who said to him where didst thou lie last night said he in the town as thou badest me quoth she o my son thou hast done the right thing for hadst thou nighted in the church she had slain thee on the foulest wise and quoth he praised be allah who hath delivered me from the evil of this night then he busied himself with the service of the church and ceased not busying till day departed and night with darkness starkened when he arose and opened the offertorychest and took thence of jewels whatso was light of weight and weighty of worth then he tarried till the first watch of the night was past when he made his way to the postern of the tunnel and opening it went forth calling on allah for protection and ceased not faring on until after finding and opening the door he came to the sea here he discovered the vessel moored to the shore near the gate and her skipper a tall old man of comely aspect with a long beard standing in the waist his ten men being ranged before him nur aldin gave him his hand as miriam had bidden him and the captain took it and pulling him on board of the ship cried out to his crew saying cast off the moorings and put out to sea with us ere day break said one of the ten o my lord the captain how shall we put out now when the king hath notified us that tomorrow he will embark in this ship and go round about the sea being fearful for his daughter miriam from the moslem thieves but the rais cried out at them saying woe to you o accursed dare ye gainsay me and bandy words with me so saying the old captain bared his blade and with it dealt the sailor who had spoken a thrust in the throat that the steel came out gleaming from his nape and quoth another of the sailors what hath our comrade done of crime that thou shouldst cut his throat thereupon the captain clapped hand to sword and smote the speaker's head nor did he leave smiting the rest of the sailors till he had slain them all one after other and cast the ten bodies ashore then he turned to nur aldin and cried out at him with a terrible great cry that made him tremble saying go down and pull up the mooringsatke nur aldin feared lest he should strike him also with the sword so he sprang up and leapt ashore and pulling up the stake jumped aboard again swiftlier than the dazzling leven the captain ceased not to bid him do this and do that and tack and wear hither and thither and look at the stars and nur aldin did all that he bade him with heart aquaking for affright whilst he himself spread the sails and the ship fared with the twain into the dashing sea swollen with clashing billowsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and eightyfourth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the old skipper had made sail he drave the ship aided by nur aldin into the dashing sea before a favouring gale meanwhile nur aldin held on to the tackle immersed in deep thought and drowned in the sea of solicitude knowing not what was hidden for him in the future and whenever he looked at the captain his heart quaked and he knew not whither the rais went with him he abode thus preoccupied with care and doubt till it was high day when he looked at the skipper and saw him take hold of his long beard and pull at it whereupon it came off in his hand and nur aldin examining it saw that it was but a false beard glued on so he straitly considered that same rais and behold it was the princess miriam his mistress and the dearling of his heart who had contrived to waylay the captain and slay him and skinned off his beard which she had stuck on to her own face at this nur aldin was transported for you and his breast broadened and he marvelled at her prowess and the stoutness of her heart and said to her welcome o my hope and my desire and the end of mine every wish then love and gladness agitated him and he made sure of winning to his hopes and his expectancy wherefore he broke out into song and chanted these coupletsto all who unknown my love for the may  from whom fate disjoins me o say i pray'ask my kith and kin of my love that aye  ensweetens my verses to lovely lay for the loss of the tribesmen my life o'er

glad and gayi have vitals shall ever be true to you  though racked by the rigours not new to youere this wrong and this right i but sue to you  do what you will to thrall who to you shall ne'er grudge his life at your feet to laywhen nur aldin ceased to sing the princess miriam marvelled at his song and thanked him therefor saying whoso's case is thus it behoveth him to walk the ways of men and never do the deed of curs and cowards now she was stout of heart and cunning in the sailing of ships over the salt sea and she knew all the winds and their shiftings and every course of the main so nur aldin said o my lady hadst thou prolonged this case on me i had surely died for stress of affright and chagrin more by token of the fire of passion and lovelonging and the cruel pangs of separation she laughed at his speech and rising without stay or delay brought out somewhat of food and liquor and they ate and drank and enjoyed themselves and made merry then she drew forth rubies and other gems and precious stones and costly trinkets of gold and silver and all manner things of price light of weight and weighty of worth which she had taken from the palace of her sire and his treasuries and displayed them to nur aldin who rejoiced therein with joy exceeding all this while the wind blew fair for them and merrily sailed the ship nor ceased sailing till they drew near the city of alexandria and sighted its landmarks old and new and pompey's pillar when they made the port nur aldin landed forthright and securing the ship to one of the fullingstones took somewhat of the treasures that miriam had brought with her and said to her o my lady tarry in the ship against i return and carry thee up into the city in such way as i should wish and will quoth she it behoveth that this be done quickly for tardiness in affairs engendereth repentance quoth he there is no tardiness in me and leaving her in the ship went up into the city to the house of the druggist his father's old fried to borrow of his wife for miriam veil and mantilla and walking boots and petticoattrousers after the usage of the women of alexandria unknowing that there was appointed to betide him of the shifts of time the father of wonders that which was far beyond his reckoning thus it befel nur aldin and miriam the girdlegirl but as regards her sire the king of france when he arose in the morning he missed his daughter and questioned her women and her eunuchs of her answered they o our lord she went out last night to go to church and after that we have no tidings of her but as the king talked with them behold there arose so great a clamour of cries below the palace that the place rang thereto and he said what may be the news the folk replied o king we have found ten men slain on the seashore and the royal yacht is missing moreover we saw the postern of the church which giveth upon the tunnel leading to the sea wide open and the moslem prisoner who served in the church is missing quoth the king an my ship be lost without doubt or disputeand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and eightyfifth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the king of france missed his daughter they brought him tidings of her saying thy yacht is lost and he replied an the craft be lost without dispute or doubt my daughter is in it so he summoned without stay or delay the captain of the port and cried out at him saying by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar except thou and thy fighting men overtake my ship forthright and bring it back to me with those who are therein i will do thee die the foulest of deaths and make a terrible example of thee thereupon the captain went out from before him trembling and betook himself to the ancient dame of the church to whom said he 'heardest thou aught from the captive that was with thee anent his native land and what countryman he was and she answered he used to say i come from the town of alexandria when the captain heard the old woman's words he returned forthright to the port and cried out to the sailors make ready and set sail so they did his bidding and straightway putting out to sea fared night and day till they sighted the city of alexandria at the very time when nur aldin landed leaving the princess in the ship they soon espied the royal yacht and knew her so they moored their own vessel at a distance therefrom and putting off in a little frigate they had with them which drew but two cubits of water and in which were an hundred fightingmen amongst them the oneeyed wazir for that he was a stubborn tyrant and a froward devil and a wily thief none could avail against his craft as he were abu mohammed albattl they ceased not rowing till they reached the bark and boarding her all at once found none therein save the princess miriam so they took her and the ship and returning to their own vessel after they had landed and waited a long while set sail forthright for the land of the franks having accomplished their errand without a fight or even drawing sword the wind blew fair for them and they sailed on without ceasing and with all diligence till they reached the city of france and landing with the princess miriam carried her to her father who received her seated on the throne of his kingship as soon as he saw her he said to her woe to thee o traitress what ailed thee to leave the faith of thy fathers and forefathers and the safeguard of the messiah on whom is our reliance and follow after the faith of the vagrants to wit the faith of alislam the which arose with the sword against the cross and the images replied miriam i am not at fault i went out by night to the church to visit the lady mary and seek a blessing of her when there fell upon me unawares a band of moslem robbers who gagged me and bound me fast and carrying me on board the barque set sail with me for their own country however i beguiled them and talked with them of their religion till they loosed my bonds and ere i knew it thy men overtook me and delivered me and by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar and the cross and the crucified thereon i rejoiced with joy exceeding in my release from them and my bosom broadened and i was glad for my deliverance from the bondage of the moslems rejoined the king thou liest o whore o adultress by the virtue of that which is revealed of prohibition and permission in the manifest evangel i will assuredly do thee die by the foulest of deaths and make thee the vilest of examples did it not suffice thee to do as thou didst the first time and put off thy lies upon us but thou must return upon us with thy deceitful inventions thereupon the king bade kill her and crucify her over the palace gate but at that moment the oneeyed wazir who had long been enamoured of the princess came in to him and said ho king saly her not but give her to me to wife and i will watch over her with the utmost warding nor will i go in unto her till i have built her a palace of solid stone exceeding high of foundation so no thieves may avail to climb up to its terraceroof and when i have made an end of building it i will sacrifice thirty moslems before the gate thereof as an expiatory offering to the messiah for myself and for her the king granted his request and bade the priests and monks and patriarchs marry the princess to him so they did his bidding whereupon he bade set about building a strong and lofty palace befitting her rank and the workmen fell to work upon it on this wise it betided the princess miriam and her sire and the oneeyed wazir but as regards nur aldin when he came back with the petticoattrousers and mantilla and walking boots and all the attire of alexandrian women which he had borrowed of the druggist's wife he found the air void and the fane afarand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and eightysixth nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when nur aldin found the aire void and the fane afar his heart sank within him and he wept floods of tears and recited these versesthe phantom of soada came by nigh to wake me towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the desertbut when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom i saw the air vacant and the place of visitation distantthen nur aldin walked on along the seashore and turned right and left till he saw folk gathered together on the beach and heard them say o moslems there remaineth no honour to alexandriacity since the franks enter it and snatch away those who are therein and return to their own land at their leisure nor pursued of any of the moslems or fighters for the faith quoth nur aldin to them what is to do and quoth they o my son one of the ships of the franks full of armed men came down but now upon the port and carried off a ship which was moored here with her that was therein and made unmolested for their own land nur aldin fell down aswoon on hearing these words and when he recovered they questioned him of his case and he told them all that had befallen him first and last whereupon they all took to reviling him and railing at him saying why couldst thou not bring her up into the town without mantilla and muffler and all and each of the folk gave him some grievous word berating him with sharp speech and shooting at him some shaft or reproach albeit one said let him be that which hath befallen him sufficeth him till he again fell down in a faintingfit and behold at this moment up came the old druggist who seeing the folk gathered together drew near to learn what was the matter and found nur aldin lying aswoon in their midst so he sat down at his head and arousing him said to him as soon as he recovered o my son what is this case in which i see thee nur aldin said o uncle i had brought back in a barque my lost slavegirl from her father's city suffering patiently all i suffered of perils and hardships and when i came with her to this port i made the vessel fast to the shore and leaving her therein repaired to thy dwelling and took of thy consort what was needful for her that i might bring her up into the town but the franks came and capturing barque and damsel made off unhindered and returned to their own land now when the shaykh the druggist heard this the light in his eyes became night and he grieved with sore grieving for nur aldin and said to him o my son why didst thou not bring her out of the ship into the city without mantilla but speech availeth not at this season so rise o my son and come up with me to the city haply allah will vouchsafe thee a girl fairer than she who shall console thee for her alhamdolillahpraised be allahwho hath not made thee lose aught by her nay thou hast gained by her and bethink thee o my son that union and disunion are in the hands of the most high king replied nur aldin by allah o uncle i can never be consoled for her loss nor will i ever leave seeking her though on her account i drink the cup of death rejoined the druggist o my son and what art thou minded to do quoth nur aldin i am minded to return to the land of the franks and enter the city of france and emperil myself there come what may loss of life or gain of life quoth the druggist o my son there is an old saw 'not always doth the crock escape the shock' and if they did thee no hurt the first time belike they will slay thee this time more by token that they know thee now with full knowledge quoth nur aldin o my uncle let me set out and be slain for the love of her straightway and not die of despair for her loss by slow torments now as fate determined there was then a ship in port ready to sail for its passengers had made an end of their affairs and the sailors had pulled up the mooringstakes when nur aldin embarked in her so they shook out their canvas and relying on the compassionate put out to sea and sailed many days with fair wind and weather till behold they fell in with certain of the frank cruisers which were scouring those waters and seizing upon all ships they saw in their fear for the king's daughter from the moslem corsairs and as often as they made prize of a moslem ship they carried all her people to the king of france who put them to death in fulfilment of the vow he had vowed on account of his daughter miriam so seeing the ship wherein was nur aldin they boarded her and taking him and the rest of the company prisoners to the number of an hundred moslems carried them to the king and set them between his hands he bade cut their throats accordingly they slaughtered them all forthwith one after another till there was none left but nur aldin whom the headsman had left to the last in pity of his tender age and slender shape when the king saw him he knew him right well and said to him art thou not nur aldin who was with us before said he i was never with thee and my name is not nur aldin but ibrahim rejoined the king thou liest thou art nur aldin he whom i gave to the ancient dame the prioress to help her in the service of the church but nur aldin replied o my lord my name is ibrahim quoth the king wait a while and bade his knights fetch the old woman forthright saying when she cometh and seeth thee she will know an thou be nur aldin or not at this juncture behold in came the oneeyed wazir who had married the princess and kissing the earth before the king said to him know o king that the palace is finished and thou knowest how i vowed to the messiah that when i had made an end of building it i would cut thirty moslems' throats before its doors wherefore i am come to take them of thee that i may sacrifice them and so fulfil my vow to the messiah they shall be at my charge by way of loan and whenas there come prisoners to my hands i will give thee other thirty in lieu of them replied the king 'by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar i have but this one captive left and he pointed to nur aldin saying take him and slaughter him at this very moment and the rest i will send thee when there come to my hands other prisoners of the moslems thereupon the oneeyed wazir arose and took nur aldin and carried him to his palace thinking to slaughter him on the threshold of the gate but the painters said to him o my lord we have two days' painting yet to do so bear with us and delay to cut the throat of this captive till we have made an end of our work haply by that time the rest of the thirty will come so thou mayst despatch them all at one bout and accomplish thy vow in a single day thereupon the wazir bade imprison nur aldinand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and eightyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the wazir bade imprison nur aldin they carried him to the stables and left him there in chains hungering and thirsting and making moan for himself for indeed he saw death face to face now it fortuned by the ordinance of destiny and foreordained fate that the king had two stallions own brothers such as the chosroe kings might sigh in vain to possess themselves of one of them they were called sbik and lhik and one of them was pure silvern white while the other was black as the darksome night and all the kings of the isles had said whoso stealeth us one of these stallions we will give him all he seeketh of red gold and pearls and gems but none could avail to steal them now one of them fell sick of a jaundice and there came a whiteness over his eyes whereupon the king gathered together all the farriers in the city to treat him but they all failed of his cure presently the wazir came into the king and finding him troubled because of the horse thought to do away his concern and said to him o king give me the stallion and i will cure him the king consented and caused carry the horse to the stable wherein nur aldin lay chained but when he missed his brother he cried out with an exceeding great cry and neighed so that he affrighted all the folk the wazir seeing that he did thus but because he was parted from his brother went to tell the king who said if this which is but a beast cannot brook to be parted from his brother how should it be with those that have reason and he bade his grooms take the other horse and put him with his brother in the wazir's stables saying tell the minister that the two stallions be a gift from me to him for the sake of my daughter miriam nur aldin was lying in the stable chained and shackled when they brought in the two stallions and he saw that one of them had a film over his eyes now he had some knowledge of horses and of the doctoring of their diseases so he said to himself this by allah is my opportunity i will go to the wazir and lie to him saying 'i will heal thee this horse' then will i do with him somewhat that shall destroy his eyes and he will slay me and i shall be at rest from this woefull life so he waited till the wazir entered the stable to look upon the steed and said to him o my lord what will be my due an i heal this horse and make his eyes whole again replied the wazir as my head liveth an thou cure him i will spare thy life and give thee leave to crave a boon of me and nur aldin said o my lord bid my hands be unbound so the wazir bade unbind him and he rose and taking virgin glass brayed it and mixed it with unslaked lime and a menstruum of onionjuice then he applied the whole to the horse's eyes and bound them up saying in himself now will his eyes be put out and they will slay me and i shall be at rest from this woefull life then he passed the night with a heart free from the uncertainty of cark and care humbling himself to allah the most high and saying o lord in thy knowledge is that which dispenseth with asking and craving now when the morning morrowed and the sun shone the wazir came to the stable and loosing the bandage from the horse's eyes considered them and found them finer than before by the ordinance of the king who openeth evermore so he said to nur aldin o moslem never in the world saw i the like of thee for the excellence of thy knowledge by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar thou makest me with wonder to admire for all the farriers of our land have failed to heal this horse then he went up to nur aldin and doing off his shackles with his own hand clad him in a costly dress and made him his master of the horse and he appointed him stipends and allowances and lodged him in a story over the stables so nur aldin abode awhile eating and drinking and making merry and bidding and forbidding those who tended the horses and whoso neglected or failed to fodder those tied up in the stable wherein was his service he would thrown down and beat with grievous beating and lay him by the legs in bilboes of iron furthermore he used every day to descend and visit the stallions and rub them down with his own hand by reason of that which he knew of their value in the wazir's eyes and his love for them wherefore the minister rejoiced in him with joy exceeding and his breast broadened and he was right glad unknowing what was to be the issue of his case now in the new palace which the oneeyed wazir had bought for princess miriam was a latticewindow overlooking his old house and the flat wherein nur aldin lodged the wazir had a daughter a virgin of extreme loveliness as she were a fleeing gazelle or a bending branchlet and it chanced that she sat one day at the lattice aforesaid and behold she heard nur aldin singing and solacing himself under his sorrows by improvising these verseso my censor who wakest amorn to see  the joys of life and its jubileehad the fangs of destiny bitten thee  in such bitter case thou hadst pled this plea 'ah me for love and his case ah me my heart is burnt by the

this moslem is a handsome youth but doubtless he is a lover separated from his mistress would heaven i wot an the beloved of this fair one is fair like unto him and if she pine for him as he for her an she be seemly as he is it behoveth him to pour forth tears and make moan of passion but an she be other than fair his days are wasted in vain regrets and he is denied the taste of delightsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the eight hundred and eightyeighth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir's daughter said to herself an his beloved be fair as he it behoveth him to pour forth tears and if other than fair his heart is wasted in vain regrets now miriam the girdlegirl the minister's consort had removed to the new palace the day before and the wazir's daughter knew that she was straitened of breast so she was minded to seek her and talk with her and tell her the tidings of the young man and the rhymes and verses she had heard him recite but before she could carry out her design the princess sent for her to cheer her with her converse so she went to her and found her heavy at heart and her tears hurrying down her cheeks and whilst she was weeping with sore weeping she recited these coupletsmy life is gone but lovelongings remain  and my breast is straitened with pine and painand my heart for parting to melt is fain  yet hoping that union will come again and join us in one who now are twainstint your blame to him who in heart's your thrall  with the wasted frame which his sorrows gallnor with aim of arrow his heart appal  for parted lover is saddest of all and love's cup of bitters is sweet to drainquoth the wazir's daughter to her what aileth thee o princess to be thus straitened in breast and sorrowful of thought whereupon miriam recalled the greatness of the delights that were past and recited these two coupletsi will bear in patience estrangement of friend  and on cheeks rail tears that like torrents wendhaply allah will solace my sorrow for he  neath the ribs of unease maketh ease at endsaid the wazir's daughter o princess let not thy breast be straitened but come with me straightway to the lattice for there is with us in the stable a comely young man slender of shape and sweet of speech and meseemeth he is a parted lover miriam asked and by what sign knowest thou that he is a parted lover and she answered o queen i know it by his improvising odes and verses all watches of the night and tides of the day quoth the princess in herself if what the wazir's daughter says be true these are assuredly the traits of the baffled the wretched ali nur aldin would i knew if indeed he be the youth of whom she speaketh at this thought lovelonging and distraction of passion redoubled on her and she rose at once and walking with the maiden to the lattice looked down upon the stables where she saw her love and lord nur aldin and fixing her eyes steadfastly upon him knew him with the bestest knowledge of love albeit he was sick of the greatness of his affection for her and of the fire of passion and the anguish of separation and yearning and distraction sore upon him was emaciation and he was improvising and sayingmy heart is a thrall my tears ne'er abate  and their rains the railing of clouds amate'twixt my weeping and watching and wanting love  and whining and pining for dearest mateah my burning heat my desire my lowe  for the plagues that torture my heart are eightand five upon five are in suite of them  so stand and listen

burning heart with ardours insatiateknow i'm drowned in deluge of tears and my soul  from lazlowe fares to hwiyahgoalwhen the princess miriam beheld nur aldin and heard his loquence and verse and speech she made certain that it was indeed her lord nur aldin but she concealed her case from the wazir's daughter and said to her by the virtue of the messiah and the faith which is no liar i thought not thou knewest of my sadness then she arose forthright and withdrawing from the window returned to her own place whilst the wazir's daughter went to her own occupations the princess awaited patiently awhile then returned to the window and sat there gazing upon her beloved nur aldin and delighting her eyes with his beauty and inner and outer grace and indeed she saw that he was like unto moon at full on fourteenth night but he was ever sighing with tears never drying for that he recalled whatso he had been abying so he recited these coupletsi hope for union with my love which i may ne'er obtain  at all but bitterness of life is all the gain i gainmy tears are likest to the main for ebb and flow of tide  but when i meet the blamerwight to staunch my tears i'm fainwoe to the

his mind about drinking by slow degrees and the koranic law is by no means so strict as the mullahs have made it the prohibitions revealed at widely different periods and varying in import and distinction have been discussed by albayzwi in his commentary on the above chapter he says that the first revelation was in chapt xvi  but as the passage was disregarded omar and others consulted the apostle who replied to them in chapt ii  then as this also was unnoticed came the final decision in chapt v  making wine and lots the work of satan yet excuses are never wanting to the moslem he can drink champagne and cognac both unknown in mohammed's day and he can use wine and spirits medicinally like sundry of ourselves who turn up the nose of contempt at the idea of drinking for pleasure ie

supplying a higher belief unity as opposed to plurality and its preaching a more manly attitude of mind and a more sensible rule of conduct arabic still preserves a host of words special to the

Typee (Chap. 18),Herman Melville,typee chap  lyricsswimming in company with the girls of the valleya canoeeffects of the tabooa pleasure excursion on the pondbeautiful freak of fayawaymantuamakinga stranger arrives in the valleyhis mysterious conductnative oratorythe interviewits resultsdeparture of the stranger returning health and peace of mind gave a new interest to everything around me i sought to diversify my time by as many enjoyments as lay within my reach bathing in company with troops of girls formed one of my chief amusements we sometimes enjoyed the recreation in the waters of a miniature lake to which the central stream of the valley expanded this lovely sheet of water was almost circular in figure and about three hundred yards across its beauty was indescribable all around its banks waved luxuriant masses of tropical foliage soaring high above which were seen here and there the symmetrical shaft of the cocoanut tree surmounted by its tufts of graceful branches drooping in the air like so many waving ostrich plumesthe ease and grace with which the maidens of the valley propelled themselves through the water and their familiarity with the element were truly astonishing sometimes they might be seen gliding along just under the surface without apparently moving hand or footthen throwing themselves on their sides they darted through the water revealing glimpses of their forms as in the course of their rapid progress they shot for an instant partly into the airat one moment they dived deep down into the water and the next they rose bounding to the surfacei remember upon one occasion plunging in among a parcel of these rivernymphs and counting vainly on my superior strength sought to drag some of them under the water but i quickly repented my temerity the amphibious young creatures swarmed about me like a shoal of dolphins and seizing hold of my devoted limbs tumbled me about and ducked me under the surface until from the strange noises which rang in my ears and the supernatural visions dancing before my eyes i thought i was in the land of the spirits i stood indeed as little chance among them as a cumbrous whale attacked on all sides by a legion of swordfish when at length they relinquished their hold of me they swam away in every direction laughing at my clumsy endeavours to reach themthere was no boat on the lake but at my solicitation and for my special use some of the young men attached to marheyo's household under the direction of the indefatigable korykory brought up a light and tastefully carved canoe from the sea it was launched upon the sheet of water and floated there as gracefully as a swan but melancholy to relate it produced an effect i had not anticipated the sweet nymphs who had sported with me before on the lake now all fled its vicinity the prohibited craft guarded by the edicts of the 'taboo' extended the prohibition to the waters in which it layfor a few days korykory with one or two other youths accompanied me in my excursions to the lake and while i paddled about in my light canoe would swim after me shouting and gambolling in pursuit but i as ever partial to what is termed in the 'young men's own book''the society of virtuous and intelligent young ladies' and in the absence of the mermaids the amusement became dull and insipid one morning i expressed to my faithful servitor my desire for the return of the nymphs the honest fellow looked at me bewildered for a moment and then shook his head solemnly and murmured 'taboo taboo' giving me to understand that unless the canoe was removed i could not expect to have the young ladies back again but to this procedure i was averse i not only wanted the canoe to stay where it was but i wanted the beauteous fayaway to get into it and paddle with me about the lake this latter proposition completely horrified korykory's notions of propriety he inveighed against it as something too monstrous to be thought of it not only shocked their established notions of propriety but was at variance with all their religious ordinanceshowever although the 'taboo' was a ticklish thing to meddle with i determined to test its capabilities of resisting an attack i consulted the chief mehevi who endeavoured to dissuade me from my object but i was not to be repulsed and accordingly increased the warmth of my solicitations at last he entered into a long and i have no doubt a very learned and eloquent exposition of the history and nature of the 'taboo' as affecting this particular case employing a variety of most extraordinary words which from their amazing length and sonorousness i have every reason to believe were of a theological nature but all that he said failed to convince me partly perhaps because i could not comprehend a word that he uttered but chiefly that for the life of me i could not understand why a woman would not have as much right to enter a canoe as a man at last he became a little more rational and intimated that out of the abundant love he bore me he would consult with the priests and see what could be donehow it was that the priesthood of typee satisfied the affair with their consciences i know not but so it was and fayaway dispensation from this portion of the taboo was at length procured such an event i believe never before had occurred in the valley but it was high time the islanders should be taught a little gallantry and i trust that the example i set them may produce beneficial effects ridiculous indeed that the lovely creatures should be obliged to paddle about in the water like so many ducks while a parcel of great strapping fellows skimmed over its surface in their canoesthe first day after fayaway's emancipation i had a delightful little party on the lakethe damsels' korykory and myself my zealous bodyservant brought from the house a calabash of poeepoee half a dozen young cocoanutsstripped of their husksthree pipes as many yams and me on his back a part of the way something of a load but korykory was a very strong man for his size and by no means brittle in the spine we had a very pleasant day my trusty valet plied the paddle and swept us gently along the margin of the water beneath the shades of the overhanging thickets fayaway and i reclined in the stern of the canoe on the very best terms possible with one another the gentle nymph occasionally placing her pipe to her lip and exhaling the mild fumes of the tobacco to which her rosy breath added a fresh perfume strange as it may seem there is nothing in which a young and beautiful female appears to more advantage than in the act of smoking how captivating is a peruvian lady swinging in her gailywoven hammock of grass extended between two orangetrees and inhaling the fragrance of a choice cigarrobut fayaway holding in her delicately formed olive hand the long yellow reed of her pipe with its quaintly carved bowl and every few moments languishingly giving forth light wreaths of vapour from her mouth and nostrils looked still more engagingwe floated about thus for several hours when i looked up to the warm glowing tropical sky and then down into the transparent depths below and when my eye wandering from the bewitching scenery around fell upon the grotesquelytattooed form of korykory and finally encountered the pensive gaze of fayaway i thought i had been transported to some fairy region so unreal did everything appearthis lovely piece of water was the coolest spot in all the valley and i now made it a place of continual resort during the hottest period of the day one side of it lay near the termination of a long gradually expanding gorge which mounted to the heights that environed the vale the strong trade wind met in its course by these elevations circled and eddied about their summits and was sometimes driven down the steep ravine and swept across the valley ruffling in its passage the otherwise tranquil surface of the lakeone day after we had been paddling about for some time i disembarked korykory and paddled the canoe to the windward side of the lake as i turned the canoe fayaway who was with me seemed all at once to be struck with some happy idea with a wild exclamation of delight she disengaged from her person the ample robe of tappa which was knotted over her shoulder for the purpose of shielding her from the sun and spreading it out like a sail stood erect with upraised arms in the head of the canoe we american sailors pride ourselves upon our straight clean spars but a prettier little mast than fayaway made was never shipped aboard of any craftin a moment the tappa was distended by the breezethe long brown tresses of fayaway streamed in the airand the canoe glided rapidly through the water and shot towards the shore seated in the stern i directed its course with my paddle until it dashed up the soft sloping bank and fayaway with a light spring alighted on the ground whilst korykory who had watched our manoeuvres with admiration now clapped his hands in transport and shouted like a madman many a time afterwards was this feat repeatedif the reader has not observed ere this that i was the declared admirer of miss fayaway all i can say is that he is little conversant with affairs of the heart and i certainly shall not trouble myself to enlighten him any farther out of the calico i had brought from the ship i made a dress for this lovely girl in it she looked i must confess something like an operadancerthe drapery of the latter damsel generally commences a little above the elbows but my island beauty's began at the waist and terminated sufficiently far above the ground to reveal the most bewitching ankle in the universethe day that fayaway first wore this robe was rendered memorable by a new acquaintance being introduced to me in the afternoon i was lying in the house when i heard a great uproar outside but being by this time pretty well accustomed to the wild halloos which were almost continually ringing through the valley i paid little attention to it until old marheyo under the influence of some strange excitement rushed into my presence and communicated the astounding tidings 'marnoo pemi' which being interpreted implied that an individual by the name of marnoo was approachingmy worthy old friend evidently expected that this intelligence would produce a great effect upon me and for a time he stood earnestly regarding me as if curious to see how i should conduct myself but as i remained perfectly unmoved the old gentleman darted out of the house again in as great a hurry as he had entered it'marnoo marnoo' cogitated i 'i have never heard that name before some distinguished character i presume from the prodigious riot the natives are making' the tumultuous noise drawing nearer and nearer every moment while 'marnoomarnoo' was shouted by every tonguei made up my mind that some savage warrior of consequence who had not yet enjoyed the honour of an audience was desirous of paying his respects on the present occasion so vain had i become by the lavish attention to which i had been accustomed that i felt half inclined as a punishment for such neglect to give this marnoo a cold reception when the excited throng came within view convoying one of the most striking specimens of humanity that i ever beheldthe stranger could not have been more than twentyfive years of age and was a little above the ordinary height had he a single hair's breadth taller the matchless symmetry of his form would have been destroyed his unclad limbs were beautifully formed whilst the elegant outline of his figure together with his beardless cheeks might have entitled him to the distinction of standing for the statue of the polynesian apollo and indeed the oval of his countenance and the regularity of every feature reminded one of an antique bust but the marble repose of art was supplied by a warmth and liveliness of expression only to be seen in the south sea islander under the most favourable developments of nature the hair of marnoo was a rich curling brown and twined about his temples and neck in little close curling ringlets which danced up and down continually when he was animated in conversation his cheek was of a feminine softness and his face was free from the least blemish of tattooing although the rest of his body was drawn all over with fanciful figures whichunlike the unconnected sketching usual among these nativesappeared to have been executed in conformity with some general designthe tattooing on his back in particular attracted my attention the artist employed must indeed have excelled in his profession traced along the course of the spine was accurately delineated the slender tapering and diamond checkered shaft of the beautiful 'artu' tree branching from the stem on each side and disposed alternately were the graceful branches drooping with leaves all correctly drawn and elaborately finished indeed the best specimen of the fine arts i had yet seen in typee a rear view of the stranger might have suggested the idea of a spreading vine tacked against a garden wall upon his breast arms and legs were exhibited an infinite variety of figures every one of which however appeared to have reference to the general effect sought to be produced the tattooing i have described was of the brightest blue and when contrasted with the light olivecolour of the skin produced an unique and even elegant effect a slight girdle of white tappa scarcely two inches in width but hanging before and behind in spreading tassels composed the entire costume of the strangerhe advanced surrounded by the islanders carrying under one arm a small roll of native cloth and grasping in his other hand a long and richly decorated spear his manner was that of a traveller conscious that he is approaching a comfortable stage in his journey every moment he turned goodhumouredly on the throng around him and gave some dashing sort of reply to their incessant queries which appeared to convulse them with uncontrollable mirthstruck by his demeanour and the peculiarity of his appearance so unlike that of the shavencrowned and facetattooed natives in general i involuntarily rose as he entered the house and proffered him a seat on the mats beside me but without deigning to notice the civility or even the more incontrovertible fact of my existence the stranger passed on utterly regardless of me and flung himself upon the further end of the long couch that traversed the sole apartment of marheyo's habitationhad the belle of the season in the pride of her beauty and power been cut in a place of public resort by some supercilious exquisite she could not have felt greater indignation than i did at this unexpected slighti was thrown into utter astonishment the conduct of the savages had prepared me to anticipate from every newcomer the same extravagant expressions of curiosity and regard the singularity of his conduct however only roused my desire to discover who this remarkable personage might be who now engrossed the attention of every onetinor placed before him a calabash of poeepoee from which the stranger regaled himself alternating every mouthful with some rapid exclamation which was eagerly caught up and echoed by the crowd that completely filled the house when i observed the striking devotion of the natives to him and their temporary withdrawal of all attention from myself i felt not a little piqued the glory of tommo is departed thought i and the sooner he removes from the valley the better these were my feelings at the moment and they were prompted by that glorious principle inherent in all heroic naturesthe strongrooted determination to have the biggest share of the pudding or to go without any of itmarnoo that allattractive personage having satisfied his hunger and inhaled a few whiffs from a pipe which was handed to him launched out into an harangue which completely enchained the attention of his auditorslittle as i understood of the language yet from his animated gestures and the varying expression of his featuresreflected as from so many mirrors in the countenances around him i could easily discover the nature of those passions which he sought to arouse from the frequent recurrence of the words 'nukuheva' and 'frannee' french and some others with the meaning of which i was acquainted he appeared to be rehearsing to his auditors events which had recently occurred in the neighbouring bays but how he had gained the knowledge of these matters i could not understand unless it were that he had just come from nukuhevaa supposition which his travelstained appearance not a little supported but if a native of that region i could not account for his friendly reception at the hands of the typeesnever certainly had i beheld so powerful an exhibition of natural eloquence as marnoo displayed during the course of his oration the grace of the attitudes into which he threw his flexible figure the striking gestures of his naked arms and above all the fire which shot from his brilliant eyes imparted an effect to the continually changing accents of his voice of which the most accomplished orator might have been proud at one moment reclining sideways upon the mat and leaning calmly upon his bended arm he related circumstantially the aggressions of the frenchtheir hostile visits to the surrounding bays enumerating each one in successionhappar puerka nukuheva tiorand then starting to his feet and precipitating himself forward with clenched hands and a countenance distorted with passion he poured out a tide of invectives falling back into an attitude of lofty command he exhorted the typees to resist these encroachments reminding them with a fierce glance of exultation that as yet the terror of their name had preserved them from attack and with a scornful sneer he sketched in ironical terms the wondrous intrepidity of the french who with five warcanoes and hundreds of men had not dared to assail the naked warriors of their valleythe effect he produced upon his audience was electric one and all they stood regarding him with sparkling eyes and trembling limbs as though they were listening to the inspired voice of a prophetbut it soon appeared that marnoo's powers were as versatile as they were extraordinary as soon as he had finished his vehement harangue he threw himself again upon the mats and singling out individuals in the crowd addressed them by name in a sort of bantering style the humour of which though nearly hidden from me filled the whole assembly with uproarious delighthe had a word for everybody and turning rapidly from one to another gave utterance to some hasty witticism which was sure to be followed by peals of laughter to the females as well as to the men he addressed his discourse heaven only knows what he said to them but he caused smiles and blushes to mantle their ingenuous faces i am indeed very much inclined to believe that marnoo with his handsome person and captivating manners was a sad deceiver among the simple maidens of the islandduring all this time he had never for one moment deigned to regard me he appeared indeed to be altogether unconscious of my presence i was utterly at a loss how to account for this extraordinary conduct i easily perceived that he was a man of no little consequence among the islanders that he possessed uncommon talents and was gifted with a higher degree of knowledge than the inmates of the valley for these reasons i therefore greatly feared lest having from some cause or other unfriendly feelings towards me he might exert his powerful influence to do me mischiefit seemed evident that he was not a permanent resident of the vale and yet whence could he have come on all sides the typees were girt in by hostile tribes and how could he possibly if belonging to any of these be received with so much cordialitythe personal appearance of the enigmatical stranger suggested additional perplexities the face free from tattooing and the unshaven crown were peculiarities i had never before remarked in any part of the island and i had always heard that the contrary were considered the indispensable distinction of a marquesan warrior altogether the matter was perfectly incomprehensible to me and i awaited its solution with no small degree of anxietyat length from certain indications i suspected that he was making me the subject of his remarks although he appeared cautiously to avoid either pronouncing my name or looking in the direction where i lay all at once he rose from the mats where he had been reclining and still conversing moved towards me his eye purposely evading mine and seated himself within less than a yard of me i had hardly recovered from my surprise when he suddenly turned round and with a most benignant countenance extended his right hand gracefully towards me of course i accepted the courteous challenge and as soon as our palms met he bent towards me and murmured in musical accents'how you do' 'how long you been in this bay' 'you like this bay'had i been pierced simultaneously by three happar spears i could not have started more than i did at hearing these simple questions for a moment i was overwhelmed with astonishment and then answered something i know not what but as soon as i regained my selfpossession the thought darted through my mind that from this individual i might obtain that information regarding toby which i suspected the natives had purposely withheld from me accordingly i questioned him concerning the disappearance of my companion but he denied all knowledge of the matter i then inquired from whence he had come he replied from nukuheva when i expressed my surprise he looked at me for a moment as if enjoying my perplexity and then with his strange vivacity exclaimed'ah me taboome go nukuhevame go tiorme go typeeme go everywherenobody harm meme taboo'this explanation would have been altogether unintelligible to me had it not recalled to my mind something i had previously heard concerning a singular custom among these islanders though the country is possessed by various tribes whose mutual hostilities almost wholly prelude any intercourse between them yet there are instances where a person having ratified friendly relations with some individual belonging longing to the valley whose inmates are at war with his own may under particular restrictions venture with impunity into the country of his friend where under other circumstances he would have been treated as an enemy in this light are personal friendships regarded among them and the individual so protected is said to be 'taboo' and his person to a certain extent is held as sacred thus the stranger informed me he had access to all the valleys in the islandcurious to know how he had acquired his knowledge of english i questioned him on the subject at first for some reason or other he evaded the inquiry but afterwards told me that when a boy he had been carried to sea by the captain of a trading vessel with whom he had stayed three years living part of the time with him at sidney in australia and that at a subsequent visit to the island the captain had at his own request permitted him to remain among his countrymen the natural quickness of the savage had been wonderfully improved by his intercourse with the white men and his partial knowledge of a foreign language gave him a great ascendancy over his less accomplished countrymenwhen i asked the now affable marnoo why it was that he had not previously spoken to me he eagerly inquired what i had been led to think of him from his conduct in that respect i replied that i had supposed him to be some great chief or warrior who had seen plenty of white men before and did not think it worth while to notice a poor sailor at this declaration of the exalted opinion i had formed of him he appeared vastly gratified and gave me to understand that he had purposely behaved in that manner in order to increase my astonishment as soon as he should see proper to address memarnoo now sought to learn my version of the story as to how i came to be an inmate of the typee valley when i related to him the circumstances under which toby and i had entered it he listened with evident interest but as soon as i alluded to the absence yet unaccounted for of my comrade he endeavoured to change the subject as if it were something he desired not to agitate it seemed indeed as if everything connected with toby was destined to beget distrust and anxiety in my bosom notwithstanding marnoo's denial of any knowledge of his fate i could not avoid suspecting that he was deceiving me and this suspicion revived those frightful apprehensions with regard to my own fate which for a short time past had subsided in my breastinfluenced by these feelings i now felt a strong desire to avail myself of the stranger's protection and under his safeguard to return to nukuheva but as soon as i hinted at this he unhesitatingly pronounced it to be entirely impracticable assuring me that the typees would never consent to my leaving the valley although what he said merely confirmed the impression which i had before entertained still it increased my anxiety to escape from a captivity which however endurable nay delightful it might be in some respects involved in its issues a fate marked by the most frightful contingenciesi could not conceal from my mind that toby had been treated in the same friendly manner as i had been and yet all their kindness terminated with his mysterious disappearance might not the same fate await mea fate too dreadful to think of stimulated by these considerations i urged anew my request to marnoo but he only set forth in stronger colours the impossibility of my escape and repeated his previous declaration that the typees would never be brought to consent to my departurewhen i endeavoured to learn from him the motives which prompted them to hold me a prisoner marnoo again presumed that mysterious tone which had tormented me with apprehension when i had questioned him with regard to the fate of my companionthus repulsed in a manner which only served by arousing the most dreadful forebodings to excite me to renewed attempts i conjured him to intercede for me with the natives and endeavour to procure their consent to my leaving them to this he appeared strongly averse but yielding at last to my importunities he addressed several of the chiefs who with the rest had been eyeing us intently during the whole of our conversation his petition however was at once met with the most violent disapprobation manifesting itself in angry glances and gestures and a perfect torrent of passionate words directed to both him and myself marnoo evidently repenting the step he had taken earnestly deprecated the resentment of the crowd and in a few moments succeeded in pacifying to some extent the clamours which had broken out as soon as his proposition had been understoodwith the most intense interest had i watched the reception his intercession might receive and a bitter pang shot through my heart at the additional evidence now furnished of the unchangeable determination of the islanders marnoo told me with evident alarm in his countenance that although admitted into the bay on a friendly footing with its inhabitants he could not presume to meddle with their concerns as such procedure if persisted in would at once absolve the typees from the restraints of the 'taboo' although so long as he refrained from such conduct it screened him effectually from the consequences of the enmity they bore his tribe at this moment mehevi who was present angrily interrupted him and the words which he uttered in a commanding tone evidently meant that he must at once cease talking to me and withdraw to the other part of the house marnoo immediately started up hurriedly enjoining me not to address him again and as i valued my safety to refrain from all further allusion to the subject of my departure and then in compliance with the order of the determined chief but not before it had again been angrily repeated he withdrew to a distancei now perceived with no small degree of apprehension the same savage expression in the countenances of the natives which had startled me during the scene at the ti they glanced their eyes suspiciously from marnoo to me as if distrusting the nature of an intercourse carried on as it was in a language they could not understand and they seemed to harbour the belief that already we had concerted measures calculated to elude their vigilancethe lively countenances of these people are wonderfully indicative of the emotions of the soul and the imperfections of their oral language are more than compensated for by the nervous eloquence of their looks and gestures i could plainly trace in every varying expression of their faces all those passions which had been thus unexpectedly aroused in their bosomsit required no reflection to convince me from what was going on that the injunction of marnoo was not to be rashly slighted and accordingly great as was the effort to suppress my feelings i accosted mehevi in a goodhumoured tone with a view of dissipating any ill impression he might have received but the ireful angry chief was not so easily mollified he rejected my advances with that peculiarly stern expression i have before described and took care by the whole of his behaviour towards me to show the displeasure and resentment which he feltmarnoo at the other extremity of the house apparently desirous of making a diversion in my favour exerted himself to amuse with his pleasantries the crowd about him but his lively attempts were not so successful as they had previously been and foiled in his efforts he rose gravely to depart no one expressed any regret at this movement so seizing his roll of tappa and grasping his spear he advanced to the front of the pipi and waving his hand in adieu to the now silent throng cast upon me a glance of mingled pity and reproach and flung himself into the path which led from the house i watched his receding figure until it was lost in the obscurity of the grove and then gave myself up to the most desponding reflections
Typee (Chap. 29),Herman Melville,typee chap  lyricsnatural history of the valleygolden lizardstameness of the birdsmosquitoesfliesdogsa solitary catthe climatethe cocoanut treesingular modes of climbing itan agile young chieffearlessness of the childrentootoo and the cocoanut treethe birds of the valleyi think i must enlighten the reader a little about the natural history of the valleywhence in the name of count buffon and baron cuvier came those dogs that i saw in typee dogsbig hairless rats rather all with smooth shining speckled hidesfat sides and very disagreeable faces whence could they have come that they were not the indigenous production of the region i am firmly convinced indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers looking fairly ashamed and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner it was plain enough they did not feel at home in the valethat they wished themselves well out of it and back to the ugly country from which they must have comescurvy curs they were my abhorrence i should have liked nothing better than to have been the death of every one of them in fact on one occasion i intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to mehevi but the benevolent king would not consent to it he heard me very patiently but when i had finished shook his head and told me in confidence that they were 'taboo'as for the animal that made the fortune of the exlordmayor whittington i shall never forget the day that i was lying in the house about noon everybody else being fast asleep and happening to raise my eyes met those of a big black spectral cat which sat erect in the doorway looking at me with its frightful goggling green orbs like one of those monstrous imps that torment some of teniers' saints i am one of those unfortunate persons to whom the sight of these animals are at any time an insufferable annoyancethus constitutionally averse to cats in general the unexpected apparition of this one in particular utterly confounded me when i had a little recovered from the fascination of its glance i started up the cat fled and emboldened by this i rushed out of the house in pursuit but it had disappeared it was the only time i ever saw one in the valley and how it got there i cannot imagine it is just possible that it might have escaped from one of the ships at nukuheva it was in vain to seek information on the subject from the natives since none of them had seen the animal the appearance of which remains a mystery to me to this dayamong the few animals which are to be met with in typee there was none which i looked upon with more interest than a beautiful goldenhued species of lizard it measured perhaps five inches from head to tail and was most gracefully proportioned numbers of those creatures were to be seen basking in the sunshine upon the thatching of the houses and multitudes at all hours of the day showed their glittering sides as they ran frolicking between the spears of grass or raced in troops up and down the tall shafts of the cocoanut trees but the remarkable beauty of these little animals and their lively ways were not their only claims upon my admiration they were perfectly tame and insensible to fear frequently after seating myself upon the ground in some shady place during the heat of the day i would be completely overrun with them if i brushed one off my arm it would leap perhaps into my hair when i tried to frighten it away by gently pinching its leg it would turn for protection to the very hand that attacked itthe birds are also remarkably tame if you happened to see one perched upon a branch within reach of your arm and advanced towards it it did not fly away immediately but waited quietly looking at you until you could almost touch it and then took wing slowly less alarmed at your presence it would seem than desirous of removing itself from your path had salt been less scarce in the valley than it was this was the very place to have gone birding with it i remember that once on an uninhabited island of the gallipagos a bird alighted on my outstretched arm while its mate chirped from an adjoining tree its tameness far from shocking me as a similar occurrence did selkirk imparted to me the most exquisite thrill of delight i ever experienced and with somewhat of the same pleasure did i afterwards behold the birds and lizards of the valley show their confidence in the kindliness of manamong the numerous afflictions which the europeans have entailed upon some of the natives of the south seas is the accidental introduction among them of that enemy of all repose and ruffler of even tempersthe mosquito at the sandwich islands and at two or three of the society group there are now thriving colonies of these insects who promise ere long to supplant altogether the aboriginal sandflies they sting buzz and torment from one end of the year to the other and by incessantly exasperating the natives materially obstruct the benevolent labours of the missionariesfrom this grievous visitation however the typees are as yet wholly exempt but its place is unfortunately in some degree supplied by the occasional presence of a minute species of fly which without stinging is nevertheless productive of no little annoyance the tameness of the birds and lizards is as nothing when compared to the fearless confidence of this insect he will perch upon one of your eyelashes and go to roost there if you do not disturb him or force his way through your hair or along the cavity of the nostril till you almost fancy he is resolved to explore the very brain itself on one occasion i was so inconsiderate as to yawn while a number of them were hovering around me i never repeated the act some halfdozen darted into the open apartment and began walking about its ceiling the sensation was dreadful i involuntarily closed my mouth and the poor creatures being enveloped in inner darkness must in their consternation have stumbled over my palate and been precipitated into the gulf beneath at any rate though i afterwards charitably held my mouth open for at least five minutes with a view of affording egress to the stragglers none of them ever availed themselves of the opportunitythere are no wild animals of any kind on the island unless it be decided that the natives themselves are such the mountains and the interior present to the eye nothing but silent solitudes unbroken by the roar of beasts of prey and enlivened by few tokens even of minute animated existence there are no venomous reptiles and no snakes of any description to be found in any of the valleysin a company of marquesan natives the weather affords no topic of conversation it can hardly be said to have any vicissitudes the rainy season it is true brings frequent showers but they are intermitting and refreshing when an islander bound on some expedition rises from his couch in the morning he is never solicitous to peep out and see how the sky looks or ascertain from what quarter the wind blows he is always sure of a 'fine day' and the promise of a few genial showers he hails with pleasure there is never any of that 'remarkable weather' on the islands which from time immemorial has been experienced in america and still continues to call forth the wondering conversational exclamations of its elderly citizens nor do there even occur any of those eccentric meteorological changes which elsewhere surprise us in the valley of typee icecreams would never be rendered less acceptable by sudden frosts nor would picnic parties be deferred on account of inauspicious snowstorms for there day follows day in one unvarying round of summer and sunshine and the whole year is one long tropical month of june just melting into julyit is this genial climate which causes the cocoanuts to flourish as they do this invaluable fruit brought to perfection by the rich soil of the marquesas and home aloft on a stately column more than a hundred feet from the ground would seem at first almost inaccessible to the simple natives indeed the slender smooth and soaring shaft without a single limb or protuberance of any kind to assist one in mounting it presents an obstacle only to be overcome by the surprising agility and ingenuity of the islanders it might be supposed that their indolence would lead them patiently to await the period when the ripened nuts slowly parting from their stems fall one by one to the ground this certainly would be the case were it not that the young fruit encased in a soft green husk with the incipient meat adhering in a jellylike pellicle to its sides and containing a bumper of the most delicious nectar is what they chiefly prize they have at least twenty different terms to express as many progressive stages in the growth of the nut many of them reject the fruit altogether except at a particular period of its growth which incredible as it may appear they seemed to me to be able to ascertain within an hour or two others are still more capricious in their tastes and after gathering together a heap of the nuts of all ages and ingeniously tapping them will first sip from one and then from another as fastidiously as some delicate winebibber experimenting glass in hand among his dusty demijohns of different vintagessome of the young men with more flexible frames than their comrades and perhaps with more courageous souls had a way of walking up the trunk of the cocoanut trees which to me seemed little less than miraculous and when looking at them in the act i experienced that curious perplexity a child feels when he beholds a fly moving feet uppermost along a ceilingi will endeavour to describe the way in which narnee a noble young chief sometimes performed this feat for my peculiar gratification but his preliminary performances must also be recorded upon my signifying my desire that he should pluck me the young fruit of some particular tree the handsome savage throwing himself into a sudden attitude of surprise feigns astonishment at the apparent absurdity of the request maintaining this position for a moment the strange emotions depicted on his countenance soften down into one of humorous resignation to my will and then looking wistfully up to the tufted top of the tree he stands on tiptoe straining his neck and elevating his arm as though endeavouring to reach the fruit from the ground where he stands as if defeated in this childish attempt he now sinks to the earth despondingly beating his breast in wellacted despair and then starting to his feet all at once and throwing back his head raises both hands like a schoolboy about to catch a falling ball after continuing this for a moment or two as if in expectation that the fruit was going to be tossed down to him by some good spirit in the treetop he turns wildly round in another fit of despair and scampers off to the distance of thirty or forty yards here he remains awhile eyeing the tree the very picture of misery but the next moment receiving as it were a flash of inspiration he rushes again towards it and clasping both arms about the trunk with one elevated a little above the other he presses the soles of his feet close together against the tree extending his legs from it until they are nearly horizontal and his body becomes doubled into an arch then hand over hand and foot over foot he rises from the earth with steady rapidity and almost before you are aware of it has gained the cradled and embowered nest of nuts and with boisterous glee flings the fruit to the groundthis mode of walking the tree is only practicable where the trunk declines considerably from the perpendicular this however is almost always the case some of the perfectly straight shafts of the trees leaning at an angle of thirty degreesthe less active among the men and many of the children of the valley have another method of climbing they take a broad and stout piece of bark and secure each end of it to their ankles so that when the feet thus confined are extended apart a space of little more than twelve inches is left between them this contrivance greatly facilitates the act of climbing the band pressed against the tree and closely embracing it yields a pretty firm support while with the arms clasped about the trunk and at regular intervals sustaining the body the feet are drawn up nearly a yard at a time and a corresponding elevation of the hands immediately succeeds in this way i have seen little children scarcely five years of age fearlessly climbing the slender pole of a young cocoanut tree and while hanging perhaps fifty feet from the ground receiving the plaudits of their parents beneath who clapped their hands and encouraged them to mount still higherwhat thought i on first witnessing one of these exhibitions would the nervous mothers of america and england say to a similar display of hardihood in any of their children the lacedemonian nation might have approved of it but most modern dames would have gone into hysterics at the sightat the top of the cocoanut tree the numerous branches radiating on all sides from a common centre form a sort of green and waving basket between the leaflets of which you just discern the nuts thickly clustering together and on the loftier trees looking no bigger from the ground than bunches of grapes i remember one adventurous little fellowtootoo was the rascal's namewho had built himself a sort of aerial babyhouse in the picturesque tuft of a tree adjoining marheyo's habitation he used to spend hours thererustling among the branches and shouting with delight every time the strong gusts of wind rushing down from the mountain side swayed to and fro the tall and flexible column on which he was perched whenever i heard tootoo's musical voice sounding strangely to the ear from so great a height and beheld him peeping down upon me from out his leafy covert he always recalled to my mind dibdin's lines'there's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloftto look out for the life of poor jack'birdsbright and beautiful birdsfly over the valley of typee you see them perched aloft among the immovable boughs of the majestic breadfruit trees or gently swaying on the elastic branches of the omoo skimming over the palmetto thatching of the bamboo huts passing like spirits on the wing through the shadows of the grove and sometimes descending into the bosom of the valley in gleaming flights from the mountains their plumage is purple and azure crimson and white black and gold with bills of every tint bright bloody red jet black and ivory white and their eyes are bright and sparkling they go sailing through the air in starry throngs but alas the spell of dumbness is upon them allthere is not a single warbler in the valleyi know not why it was but the sight of these birds generally the ministers of gladness always oppressed me with melancholy as in their dumb beauty they hovered by me whilst i was walking or looked down upon me with steady curious eyes from out the foliage i was almost inclined to fancy that they knew they were gazing upon a stranger and that they commiserated his fate
Typee (Chap. 28),Herman Melville,typee chap  lyricsfishing partiesmode of distributing the fishmidnight banquettimekeeping tapersunceremonious style of eating the fishthere was no instance in which the social and kindly dispositions of the typees were more forcibly evinced than in the manner the conducted their great fishing parties four times during my stay in the valley the young men assembled near the full of the moon and went together on these excursions as they were generally absent about fortyeight hours i was led to believe that they went out towards the open sea some distance from the bay the polynesians seldom use a hook and line almost always employing large wellmade nets most ingeniously fabricated from the twisted fibres of a certain bark i examined several of them which had been spread to dry upon the beach at nukuheva they resemble very much our own seines and i should think they were nearly as durableall the south sea islanders are passionately fond of fish but none of them can be more so than the inhabitants of typee i could not comprehend therefore why they so seldom sought it in their waters for it was only at stated times that the fishing parties were formed and these occasions were always looked forward to with no small degree of interestduring their absence the whole population of the place were in a ferment and nothing was talked of but 'pehee pehee' fish fish towards the time when they were expected to return the vocal telegraph was put into operationthe inhabitants who were scattered throughout the length of the valley leaped upon rocks and into trees shouting with delight at the thoughts of the anticipated treat as soon as the approach of the party was announced there was a general rush of the men towards the beach some of them remaining however about the ti in order to get matters in readiness for the reception of the fish which were brought to the taboo groves in immense packages of leaves each one of them being suspended from a pole carried on the shoulders of two meni was present at the ti on one of these occasions and the sight was most interesting after all the packages had arrived they were laid in a row under the verandah of the building and openedthe fish were all quite small generally about the size of a herring and of every variety about oneeighth of the whole being reserved for the use of the ti itself the remainder was divided into numerous smaller packages which were immediately dispatched in every direction to the remotest parts of the valley arrived at their destination these were in turn portioned out and equally distributed among the various houses of each particular district the fish were under a strict taboo until the distribution was completed which seemed to be effected in the most impartial manner by the operation of this system every man woman and child in the vale were at one and the same time partaking of this favourite article of foodonce i remember the party arrived at midnight but the unseasonableness of the tour did not repress the impatience of the islanders the carriers dispatched from the ti were to be seen hurrying in all directions through the deep groves each individual preceded by a boy bearing a flaming torch of dried cocoanut boughs which from time to time was replenished from the materials scattered along the path the wild glare of these enormous flambeaux lighting up with a startling brilliancy the innermost recesses of the vale and seen moving rapidly along beneath the canopy of leaves the savage shout of the excited messengers sounding the news of their approach which was answered on all sides and the strange appearance of their naked bodies seen against the gloomy background produced altogether an effect upon my mind that i shall long rememberit was on this same occasion that korykory awakened me at the dead hour of night and in a sort of transport communicated the intelligence contained in the words 'pehee perni' fish come as i happened to have been in a remarkably sound and refreshing slumber i could not imagine why the information had not been deferred until morning indeed i felt very much inclined to fly into a passion and box my valet's ears but on second thoughts i got quietly up and on going outside the house was not a little interested by the moving illumination which i beheldwhen old marheyo received his share of the spoils immediate preparations were made for a midnight banquet calabashes of poeepoee were filled to the brim green breadfruit were roasted and a huge cake of 'amar' was cut up with a sliver of bamboo and laid out on an immense bananaleafat this supper we were lighted by several of the native tapers held in the hands of young girls these tapers are most ingeniously made there is a nut abounding in the valley called by the typees 'armor' closely resembling our common horsechestnut the shell is broken and the contents extracted whole any number of these are strung at pleasure upon the long elastic fibre that traverses the branches of the cocoanut tree some of these tapers are eight or ten feet in length but being perfectly flexible one end is held in a coil while the other is lighted the nut burns with a fitful bluish flame and the oil that it contains is exhausted in about ten minutes as one burns down the next becomes ignited and the ashes of the former are knocked into a cocoanut shell kept for the purpose this primitive candle requires continual attention and must be constantly held in the hand the person so employed marks the lapse of time by the number of nuts consumed which is easily learned by counting the bits of tappa distributed at regular intervals along the stringi grieve to state so distressing a fact but the inhabitants of typee were in the habit of devouring fish much in the same way that a civilized being would eat a radish and without any more previous preparation they eat it raw scales bones gills and all the inside the fish is held by the tail and the head being introduced into the mouth the animal disappears with a rapidity that would at first nearly lead one to imagine it had been launched bodily down the throatraw fish shall i ever forget my sensations when i first saw my island beauty devour one oh heavens fayaway how could you ever have contracted so vile a habit however after the first shock had subsided the custom grew less odious in my eyes and i soon accustomed myself to the sight let no one imagine however that the lovely fayaway was in the habit of swallowing great vulgarlooking fishes oh no with her beautiful small hand she would clasp a delicate little goldenhued love of a fish and eat it as elegantly and as innocently as though it were a naples biscuit but alas it was after all a raw fish and all i can say is that fayaway ate it in a more ladylike manner than any other girl of the valleywhen at rome do as the romans do i held to be so good a proverb that being in typee i made a point of doing as the typees did thus i ate poeepoee as they did i walked about in a garb striking for its simplicity and i reposed on a community of couches besides doing many other things in conformity with their peculiar habits but the farthest i ever went in the way of conformity was on several occasions to regale myself with raw fish these being remarkably tender and quite small the undertaking was not so disagreeable in the main and after a few trials i positively began to relish them however i subjected them to a slight operation with a knife previously to making my repast

youroberteverything if it can be kissed he takes up a flat stone which lies on the table this stone for instance it is so cool so polished so delicate like a woman's temple it is silent it suffers our passion and it is beautiful he places it against his lips and so i kiss it because it is beautiful and what is a woman a work of nature too like a stone or a flower or a bird a kiss is an act of homagerichardit is an act of union between man and woman even if we are often led to desire through the sense of beauty can you say that the beautiful is what we desirerobertpressing the stone to his forehead you will give me a headache if you make me think today i cannot think today i feel too natural too common after all what is most attractive in even the most beautiful

Philippine Folklore Stories: Christianized Tribes - The Virtue of the Cocoanut,Mabel Cook Cole,philippine folklore stories christianized tribes  the virtue of the cocoanut lyricsthe virtue of the cocoanutvisayanone day a man took his blowgun and his dog and went to the forest to hunt as he was making his way through the thick woods he chanced upon a young cocoanut tree growing in the groundit was the first tree of this kind that he had ever seen and it seemed so peculiar to him that he stopped to look at itwhen he had gone some distance farther his attention was attracted by a noisy bird in a tree and he shot it with his blowgun by and by he took aim at a large monkey which mocked him from another treetop and that too fell dead at his feetthen he heard his dog barking furiously in the distant bushes and hastening to it he found it biting a wild pig after a hard struggle he killed the pig and then feeling satisfied with his success he took the three animals on his back and returned to the little planti have decided to take you home with me little plant he said for i like you and you may be of some use to mehe dug up the plant very carefully and started home but he had not gone far when he noticed that the leaves had begun to wilt and he did not know what to do since he had no water finally in despair he cut the throat of the bird and sprinkled the blood on the cocoanut no sooner had he done this than the plant began to revive and he continued his journeybefore he had gone far however the leaves again began to wilt and this time he revived it with the blood of the monkey then he hastened on but a third time the leaves wilted and he was compelled to stop and revive it with the blood of the pig this was his last animal so he made all the haste possible to reach home before his plant died the cocoanut began to wilt again before he reached his house but when he planted it in the ground it quickly revived and grew into a tall treethis hunter was the first man to take the liquor called tuba from the cocoanut tree and he and his friends began to drink it after they had become very fond of it the hunter said to his friendsthe cocoanut tree is like the three animals whose blood gave it life when it would have died the man who drinks three or four cups of tuba becomes like the noisy bird that i shot with my blowgun one who drinks more than three or four cups becomes like the big monkey that acts silly and one who becomes drunk is like the pig that sleeps even in a mudhole
